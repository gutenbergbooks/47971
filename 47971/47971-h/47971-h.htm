<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In this little book a very large number of the commoner
wild flowers growing in the United States, west of the
Rocky Mountains, are pictured and described. It is the
first attempt to supply a popular field book for the whole
West. The field is vast, including within its limits all sorts
of climate and soil, producing thousands of flowers, infinite
in variety and wonderful in beauty, their environment
often as different as that of Heine's <i>Pine and Palm</i>. In
such strange homes as the Grand Canyon and the Petrified
Forest of Arizona, or the deserts of Utah and southern
California, we find the oddest desert plants, forced to curious
expedients in order to sustain life amidst almost perpetual
heat and drought, but often displaying blossoms of
such brilliance and delicacy that they might well be envied
by their more fortunate sisters, flourishing beside shady
waterfalls, in a "happy valley" like Yosemite, or a splendid
mountain garden, such as spreads in many-colored
parterres of bloom around the feet of Mt. Rainier. On the
wind-swept plains hundreds of flowers are to be found;
many kinds of hardy plants brighten the salty margins of
the sea cliffs, or bloom at the edge of the snow on rocky
mountain peaks, while quantities of humble, everyday
flowers border our country roadsides or tint the hills and
meadows with lavish color.</p>

<p>The field included the States of Washington, Oregon,
California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona and to designate
this whole field the term West is used in this
book. The term Northwest designates Washington,
Oregon, northern Idaho, and northern California, and
the term Southwest covers southern California and
Arizona. The flowers found only in the Rocky Mountains
are not included, and it may be noted here that exceedingly
few of the western flowers cross the Rockies and are found
in the East.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span></p>

<p>This is the only fully illustrated book of western flowers,
except Miss Parsons's charming book, which is for California
only. The drawings have all been made from life.
Allowance must be made for differences in appearance,
owing to locality, and the text should be consulted for the
size, as, on so small a page, some of the plants must be
drawn smaller than others.</p>

<p>Almost all technical botanical terms have been translated
into ordinary English, as this book is intended
primarily for the general public, but as a large number of
the plants given have never before been illustrated, or even
described, except in somewhat inaccessible or technical
publications, it is hoped that the scientist also may find
the contents both interesting and useful.</p>

<p>The nomenclature used, with few exceptions, is that of the
American Code. Where these names differ greatly from
those in common usage the latter are given as synonyms
in brackets, making the book more useful to all readers.
The botanical names are marked with an accent. Two
accents are used, the grave (`) to indicate the long English
sound of the vowel, such as the "i" in "violet," and the
acute (´) to show the short sound, such as the "i" in "lily."</p>

<p>Professor J. J. Thornber, of the University of Arizona,
is responsible for the botanical accuracy of the text and his
knowledge and patient skill have made the book possible.</p>

<p>Thanks are due for most valuable assistance in the
determination of a very large number of specimens to Miss
Alice Eastwood, of the California Academy of Sciences.
Also to Dr. W. L. Jepson of the University of California;
Professor A. O. Garrett, of Salt Lake City; Professor A. R.
Sweetser, of the University of Oregon; Mr. S. B. Parish,
of San Bernardino, Cal.; Mrs. Henshaw, of Vancouver, B.
C.; Dr. A. Davidson, of Los Angeles; and Mr. Marcus E.
Jones, of Salt Lake City. Also for advice and assistance to
Dr. N. L. Britton, and Dr. H. M. Richards of New York;
to Dr. Livingston Farrand, of Colorado; Mr. C. R. Orcutt, of
San Diego; Mr. Carl Purdy, of Ukiah, Cal.; Professor Flett,
of Mt. Rainier National Park; Miss Winona Bailey, of
Seattle; Professor J. H. Paul, of Salt Lake City; and many
other kind friends.</p>

<p>The arrangement is that originated by Mr. Schuyler
Mathews, in his <i>Field Book of American Wild Flowers</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
which has been found very popular in the East, but, in
this book, most of the genera, as well as the species, have
been very briefly described.</p>

<h3 id="WATER-PLANTAIN_FAMILY">WATER-PLANTAIN FAMILY. <i>Alismaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A rather small family, widely distributed, growing in
fresh-water swamps and streams. The leaves are all
from the root, with long sheathing leaf-stalks, and the
flowers are regular and perfect, or with only pistils or only
stamens; the sepals three; the petals three; the stamens six
or more; the ovaries numerous, superior, developing into
dry, one-seeded nutlets.</p>

<p>There are a good many kinds of Sagittaria, with fibrous
roots and milky juice; the leaves are usually arrow-shaped;
the lower flowers usually pistillate and the upper ones
usually staminate; the stamens are numerous and the
numerous ovaries are closely crowded and form roundish
heads. The name is from the Latin for "arrow," referring
to the shape of the leaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Arrowhead</b><br />
<i>Sagittària latifòlia</i><br />
<b>White<br />

<p>An attractive and very decorative
plant, with stout, smooth, hollow flower-stems,
from eight inches to four feet tall,
with very handsome, smooth, olive-green
leaves and papery bracts. The flowers
are about an inch across, with delicately
crumpled, white petals and yellow anthers, forming a
bright golden center, and the plants look very pretty
standing along the edges of ponds. The leaves are exceedingly
variable both in size and shape. This is found
throughout North America. The tubers are edible and
hence the plant is often called Tule Potato, and they are
much eaten by the Chinese in California. The Indian
name is Wapato.</p>

<h3 id="LILY_FAMILY">LILY FAMILY. <i>Liliaceae</i>.</h3>

<p>A wonderfully beautiful family, large and widely distributed,
mostly perennial herbs, growing from bulbs or
root-stocks, with perfect, regular, symmetrical flowers and
toothless leaves. The flower-cup almost always has six
divisions, the outer often called sepals and the inner petals.
The six stamens are opposite the divisions and sometimes
three of them are without anthers. The styles or stigmas
are three and the ovary is superior, developing into a
three-celled capsule or berry, containing few or many seeds.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Anthericum, rather small, lily-like
plants, with grasslike leaves, springing from the base
and surrounded by the fibrous remnants of older leaves.
The slender stems are leafless, or have one, very small, dry
leaf; the roots thick and fleshy-fibrous; the flowers yellow,
on pedicels jointed near the middle; the style long and
slender; the pod oblong, containing several flattened,
angular seeds in each cell. They are common in rocky soil,
at altitudes of six thousand to nine thousand feet, from
western Texas to Arizona.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Amber Lily</b><br />

<p>A beautiful little plant, with delicate
flowers, unusual and pretty in coloring. It
grows from eight to fifteen inches tall and
has a slender, pale-green stem, springing
from a clump of graceful, pale bluish-green,
grasslike leaves. The flowers are about
three quarters of an inch long, pale orange or corn-color,
with a narrow stripe on each division; the pistil green, with
an orange stigma; the anthers yellow. The flowers fade
almost as soon as they bloom. This grows in open woods.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Zygadene, natives of North
America and Siberia. They mostly have coated bulbs,
resembling onions, and white or greenish flowers, in clusters,
the leaves long, smooth, folded lengthwise and springing
mostly from the root. The flowers are perfect or polygamous,
the six divisions alike, with one or two, greenish,
glandular spots at the base of each; the styles three, distinct;
the fruit a three-lobed capsule, with several or many
seeds in each compartment. The name is from the Greek
for "yoke" and "gland," because some kinds have a couple
of glands on each division of the flower.</p>

<p>A handsome, rather stout plant, about
a foot tall, with bright light-green, smooth,
graceful leaves sheathing the stem, which
has a papery bract around its base. The
flowers are in clusters varying in shape,
sometimes growing in a long, loose raceme
and sometimes in a closer, pointed cluster. The divisions
of the rather small, cream-white flowers have short claws,
with a yellow gland and a stamen at the base of each. The
stamens are conspicuous, with swinging, yellow, shield-shaped
anthers, and are at first longer than the three styles,
which gradually lengthen and, together with the stamens,
give a delicate, feathery appearance to the whole flower
cluster. This grows on dry hillsides and in meadows. The
bulb is very poisonous.</p>

<p>A handsome graceful plant, with one
or more stiff stems, from six inches to
three feet tall, springing from a large
clump of rather stiff, bluish-green leaves,
covered with a pale "bloom," and bearing
fine clusters of cream-white flowers, less
than an inch across, their divisions united below and
adhering to the base of the ovary and each with a sticky,
bright-green, heart-shaped gland. This grows in moist
places in the mountains, across the continent.</p>

lengthwise, with rough edges. The cream-colored
flowers are less than half an inch
across, striped with green on the outside,
their divisions free from the ovary and all with claws,
with roundish, greenish-yellow glands, not toothed, and
with long stamens. This grows in meadows and the bulb
is very poisonous except to hogs, so it is often called Hog's
Potato.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Veratrum, natives of the
north temperate zone; tall, perennial herbs, with thick,
short, poisonous rootstocks; stems tall and leafy, more or
less hairy; leaves broad, plaited, with conspicuous veins;
flowers more or less downy, polygamous, whitish or greenish,
in a cluster, their six, separate divisions colored alike,
adhering to the base of the ovary, without glands, or nearly
so, and without claws; stamens opposite the divisions,
with heart-shaped anthers; styles three; capsule three-lobed,
with several flat, broadly-winged seeds in each compartment.
Veratrum is the ancient name for Hellebore.

<p>The leaves of this plant are its conspicuous
feature. A few near the top are
long and narrow, but most of them are
boat-shaped, with heavy ribs, and from
six to twelve inches long. They are bright
yellowish-green and, although somewhat
coarse, the general effect is distinctly handsome, as we
see masses of them growing luxuriantly in rich, moist
meadows and marshes in the mountains. When they
first come up in the spring, the shoots are packed into
green rosettes, in which the leaves are intricately folded,
but they soon grow to a height of three to six feet. The
flowers are beautiful, in fine contrast to the coarse foliage.
They measure about half an inch across and are cream-white,
streaked with green, and form a fine cluster about
a foot long. The flowers are far prettier and the plants
handsomer than their eastern relations and they flourish
at an altitude of six to nine thousand feet. The plants
are supposed to be poisonous to cattle, but in a recent
bulletin of the Agricultural Experiment Station of the
State of Washington, it is reported as being a popular
food with horses and sheep, particularly the latter, which
eat it greedily and without ill effects.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Hastingsia, perennials, with

very striking close by, as the flowers are too colorless.

<p>There are several kinds of Chlorogalum.
This odd plant springs from a big bulb,
which is covered with coarse brown fiber
and often shows above the ground. The
leaves are sometimes over two feet long,
with rippled margins, look like very coarse
grass, and usually spread out flat on the
ground. The plants are conspicuous and look interesting
and we wonder what sort of flower is to come from them.
Then some day in late summer we find that a rather ugly,
branching stalk, four or five feet tall, has shot up from the
center of the tuft of leaves. The branches are covered
with bluish-green buds, and we watch with interest for
the bloom, but we may easily miss it, for the flowers are
very short-lived and come out only for a little while in the
afternoons. In the lowlands the flowers are rather scattered
and straggling, but in Yosemite they are lovely,
close by. Each flower is an inch or more across and looks
like an airy little lily, with six spreading divisions, white,
delicately veined with dull-blue, and they are clustered
along the branches, towards the top of the stalk, and
bloom in successive bunches, beginning at the bottom.
When they commence to bloom, the tips of the petals
remain caught together until the last minute, when
suddenly they let go and spring apart and all at once the
dull stalk, like Aaron's rod, is adorned with several delicate
clusters of feathery silver flowers. The thread-like
style is slightly three-cleft at the tip and the capsule has
one or two blackish seeds in each cell. The bulbs form
a lather in water and are used as a substitute for soap by
the Indians and Spanish-Californians, and as food by the
Pomo Indians, who cook them in great pits in the ground.
<i>Pomeridianum</i> means "in the afternoon."</p>

<p>Wild Onions are easily recognized by their characteristic
taste and odor. They mostly have coated bulbs; their
leaves are long and narrow, from the base; the flower-stalk
bears a roundish, bracted cluster of rather small, white,
pink, or magenta flowers, on slender pedicels, their six
divisions nearly alike and each with a stamen attached to
its base. The bracts enclose the buds, before blooming, in
a case and the capsule contains six, black, wrinkled seeds.
There are numerous kinds, very widely distributed, not
easily distinguished, some resembling Brodiaea, but the
latter never smell of onion. <i>Allium</i> is the Latin for
"garlic."</p>

is enveloped in two papery bracts,
forming a beautiful pink and white, iridescent
case, the shape of a turnip, at the tip
of the stalk. Later these bracts split apart
and disclose a cluster of pretty flowers, usually very deep
pink in color, the divisions each with a darker line on the
outside, the anthers pale-yellow. This is very gay and
attractive, often growing in patches on dry hillsides and
fields. The flowers last a long time in water, gradually becoming
paler in color and papery in texture. The bulb is
marked with veins.</p>

delicate and pretty, growing among rocks in shady canyons.
The bulb is usually red-coated.</p>

<p>The flower cluster of <i>Allium serràtum</i> is much more compact

<p>There are many kinds of Brodiaea, among the prettiest
western flowers. They have a small, solid bulb, coated
with brownish fibers. The stem bears a bracted, roundish
head of flowers at the top, the pedicels varying in length.
Their leaves, all from the root, are grasslike and soon wither
and the flowers dry up, become papery, and remain on the
stalk, sometimes keeping form and color for some time.
The stamens are in two sets and are attached to the flower-tube,
their filaments often winged. Sometimes three of the
stamens are without anthers and their filaments are broadened,
so that they look like small petals alternating with
the ordinary stamens.</p>

<p>All through the spring these lovely
flowers grow abundantly all over the hills
and fields of California. The slender stalks
vary from a few inches to two feet tall.
The flowers are usually purplish-blue, but
vary from deep-violet to white and are
rather translucent in texture. They measure over half an
inch across and grow in a cluster of seven or eight flowers,
with several membranous, purplish bracts at the base.
There are six anthers. The three inner stamens are winged
and form a crown in the throat of the flower-tube. These
Brodiaeas last a long time in water and are great favorites
everywhere. The little bulbs are edible and give the name
of Grass Nuts. There are several other names, such as
Cluster Lily and Hog-onion. The name Wild Hyacinth is
poor, as it does not resemble a hyacinth in character. <i>B.

<p>In early June, at the time of the hay
harvest, these handsome flowers, which
look like clusters of little blue lilies, begin
to appear among the dried grass of the hillsides
and in open places in the woods.
They vary in height from a few inches to
over a foot and the number of flowers in a
cluster also varies very much. Sometimes there are as
many as ten of the beautiful blossoms, an inch or more long,
with pedicels unequal in length and from one to four inches
long, in a large cluster at the top of the stalk, with several,
whitish, papery bracts at the base of the cluster. The
color of the flowers is usually a deep bright blue shading to
violet and the six divisions grow paler toward the base and
have a brown stripe on the outside; the buds are greenish,
striped with brown. The stamens are translucent white,
three ordinary stamens, with long erect anthers, alternating
with three without anthers, the latter tongue-shaped and
petal-like. The leaves, which are thickish and about the
same length as the stalk, have withered away before the
flowers bloom. This plant very much resembles Ithuriel's
Spear, <i>Triteleia laxa</i>, but three of the stamens are without
anthers and the ovary is not on a long stalk. It is the
commonest kind around San Francisco. B. <i>minor</i> is much
the same, but a smaller plant with fewer and smaller flowers.
The three outer divisions are narrow, with pointed tips,
and the inner blunt and broad, and the sterile stamens are
notched and longer than the fertile ones. This grows on
dry hills and plains in middle and southern California.</p>

<p>This is a strange, rather grotesque-looking
plant, with its slightly roughish, leafless,
reddish stem contorted into curious curves,
occasionally quite short but usually enormously
long, sometimes as much as eight
feet, and twining awkwardly in a snake-like
way around and over the bushes in its
neighborhood. There are sometimes a few long narrow
leaves lying on the ground, but when the flower blooms
they usually seem to have withered away. The flower-cluster
is quite compact, sometimes six inches across, comprising
from eighteen to twenty flowers, with several, large,
pink, papery bracts. The flowers are rather pretty, dull
pink outside but paler inside, the buds are deeper and more
purplish pink, both of dry papery texture. The flowers are
over half an inch across, their tubes and buds are six-angled,
and they have three stamens with anthers and wings, alternating
with three, notched, petal-like stamens, without
anthers. In the spring the stem grows rapidly for several
weeks and then the flower cluster begins to come out at the
tip. If the stem is broken off the flower comes out just the
same and the stem keeps on growing, even if it is brought
into the house. These curious plants are found in the foothills
of the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada Mountains
and may be seen in open sunny places along the stage route
from Yosemite to Wawona. In the woods near Wawona
I saw it twining around a very tall white larkspur and the
combination was exceedingly pretty. The capsule is egg-shaped
and pointed, the seeds black and angled.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of Bloomeria, all Californian, resembling
Brodiaea, but the stamens unlike. They have
a fibrous-coated, solid bulb, long narrow leaves, and a
bracted cluster of many flowers, at the top of a tall flower-stalk.
The flowers are yellow, with six, nearly equal,
spreading divisions, the six stamens on the base of the divisions,
with slender filaments, which with a microscope are
seen to have a short, two-toothed, hairy appendage at
base. These are united and form a little cup surrounding
the base of the stamens. The style is club-shaped, with a
three-lobed stigma. The roundish capsule, beaked with the
style, contains several, angular, wrinkled seeds in each cell.</p>

are bright with pretty clusters of Golden
Stars. The plant is from six to eighteen
inches tall, springing from a small bulb,
covered with brown fibers, with a long, narrow, grasslike
leaf, and a large flower-cluster, sometimes comprising as
many as fifty blossoms, at the top of the stalk. The
flowers, about an inch across, with pedicels from one and a
half to two inches long, are orange-yellow, the spreading
divisions each striped with two dark lines, and the anthers
are bright green. This looks very much like Golden
Brodiaea, but the latter has no cup at the base of the
stamens. It grows in the southern part of California
and is abundant wherever it is found. <i>B. Clevelandi</i> is
much the same, but the flowers are striped with green and
the numerous buds are green, so that it is less golden and

three-angled. The younger plants are often flowerless,
with only one broad leaf, with a long leaf-stalk. The name
is from a Greek word meaning "red," though these flowers
are mostly yellow. The common name, Dog-tooth Violet,
is old, and suggested by the little, white, toothlike offshoot
often found on the bulb, but of course they are not
in the least like Violets. In California they are often
called Chamise Lily, and sometimes Adam and Eve,
because the plant often bears a large and a small flower
at the same time. Mr. Burroughs would like to call it
Fawn Lily, on account of the mottled leaves of some kinds,
which slightly suggest the ears of a fawn. Adder's-tongue,
probably suggested by the long forked pistil, is also an
old and usual name.</p>

is a sight never to be forgotten. Pushing their bright
leaves right through the snow they gayly swing their golden
censers in the face of winter and seem the very incarnation
of spring. There are several similar kinds. In the
Utah canyons these flowers in early spring are a wonderful
sight, covering the wooded slopes with sheets of gold,
and they seem to me to be the largest and handsomest of
their clan, growing at an altitude of six thousand to eleven
thousand five hundred feet, and blooming from March
to July according to height. Easter Bells is a Utah name.</p>

<p>This is the only one of its kind, a wonderfully
beautiful desert plant, much like
an Easter Lily. The stout, pale, bluish
stem, from six inches to two feet tall, has
a delicate "bloom" and springs from a
graceful cluster of narrow leaves, which
are a foot and a half long, spreading widely, but not lying
quite flat on the ground. They are pale bluish-green,
with a narrow, crinkled, white border and folded lengthwise.
The buds are bluish and the lovely flowers are
about three inches long and pure-white, delicately striped
with pale-green and blue on the outside, with yellow anthers
and a white stigma, and with a papery bract at the
base of each pedicel. The flowers are slightly fragrant
and become papery and curiously transparent as they
wither. In dry seasons these plants do not bloom at all,
but the slightest moisture will cause them to send up a
stout stem and crown it with exquisite blossoms, which
look extraordinarily out of place on the arid desert sand
around Yuma and Ft. Mohave. The bulb is eaten by
the Indians.</p>

<p>Lilies, the "lords of gardens," are perhaps the most
beautiful and popular flowers everywhere and there are
some wonderful ones in the West. They have tall, smooth,
leafy stems, springing from scaly bulbs; large showy flowers,
solitary or in terminal clusters; smooth, netted-veined
leaves, often in whorls, and leaflike bracts. The flower-cup
is funnel-formed, or bell-shaped, and has six, equal,
spreading divisions, with a honey-bearing groove at the
base of each; the stamens, with long anthers, swinging from
the tips of long filaments; a long pistil, with a three-lobed
stigma and the capsule oblong, with two rows of flat seeds
in each of its cells. There are no true Lilies in Utah.</p>

<p>These tall plants carry a brilliant crown
of small lilies, glowing like jewels in the
dark moist woods they love. The stem is
from one and a half to six feet high, covered
with a slight down that rubs off, and
springs from a small bulb with short, thick scales. The
long, pointed, rich-green leaves are in whorls of five or six
below, more scattered towards the top of the stalk. The
flowers are rather more than an inch long, yellow at the
base of the petals, shading through orange to vermilion at
the tips and dotted with crimson in the throat. Usually
there are six or seven in a cluster, but they have been found
with many more in favorable situations and single plants
in Yosemite have been seen with as many as thirty blossoms.
The capsule is roundish and less than an inch long.
These little Lilies are among the most attractive of their
kind and grow somewhat freely in the high Sierras to an
altitude of seven thousand feet and as far north as Oregon.</p>

<p>In the Sierras, at an altitude of from
three to over seven thousand feet, and as
far north as the Columbia River, we may
be fortunate enough to find this glorious
Lily, growing in the forest in moderate
shade and protected by the chaparral. It is
not rare but nowhere very abundant. I
shall never forget finding a group of three or four, growing
near a huge fallen tree, in the woods at Wawona near Yosemite,
where it is very fine. Their raiment is even more
"white and glistering" than the cultivated Easter Lilies.
The smooth, stout, purplish stem is from two to five feet
high, adorned all the way up with successive whorls of
handsome dark-green leaves, three or four inches long, thin
in texture, with rippling margins, and shining as if they
had been varnished. There are from two to twenty blossoms
of shining white, each one from three to four inches
long and as much across. The petals are cleft to the base,
spreading wide apart when the flower is fully open, sometimes
finely dotted with purple, and becoming purplish in
fading. The anthers are yellow and the pistil green, and the
bulb is large, with thin scales. The scent is delicious,
having a whiff of spicy carnation added to the usual lily
fragrance. This is never found in the Coast Range and is
the only pure white American Lily. Shasta Lily is a variety
with a small bulb. <i>L. Párryi</i>, the Lemon Lily, of southern
California and Arizona, is similar in the form of its flowers,
which are large and clear yellow, dotted lightly with deeper
yellow. It grows in shady, moist spots in cool canyons
and is very beautiful.</p>

<p>A glorious plant, from two to five

with rippled edges. The stem bears a
magnificent cluster of blossoms, most
wonderful in coloring, for the buds and
young flowers are white, dotted with
purple inside, with yellow anthers and a pale-green pistil,
but they gradually change to pink, and deepen to ruby-purple
as they fade, and the anthers and pistil also darken
in color. The effect of the whole cluster is therefore white
at the top, shading through pink to almost crimson below.
The flowers are even more deliciously fragrant than the
Washington Lily, which they resemble, except that they
are not quite so large as the latter and stand more erect
and the petals are not so spreading. This usually grows
among chaparral in the Coast Ranges.

<p>There are many kinds of Fritillaria, natives of the north
temperate zone. In the East there are only cultivated ones,
such as the familiar Crown Imperial, but we have a number
growing wild in the West. They have bulbs with round,
thick scales, developing into bulblets and sometimes resembling
grains of rice. The flowers are bell-shaped, and nodding,
with separate and nearly equal divisions, each with a
nectar-spot at its base. They resemble Lilies, but the style
is three-cleft, the honey-gland is a shallow pit and the flowers
are smaller. The capsule is roundish and six-angled,
containing numerous flat seeds. It is conspicuous and
perhaps suggested the Latin name, meaning "dice-box."</p>

<p>This plant is beautiful and decorative, and
yet there is something weird about it. The
flowers, an inch or more across, grow four or
five in a cluster, on a smooth stalk about a
foot tall, the long, narrow leaves scattered
or in whorls. The bells, nodding on slender
flower-stalks, are very unusual in coloring.
They are greenish-yellow, streaked and spotted with
maroon, and the long curling tips of the three-pronged pistil
project like the forked tongue of an adder, so that somehow
we feel that, in a previous existence, beautiful as it is now, it
may have been a toad or some reptile. When we found this
flower growing in the Grand Canyon, halfway down Bright
Angel trail, it seemed entirely suitable to the mysterious
spirit of the place. The general effect is bronze-color and
the attractive name of Bronze Bells, or Mission Bells, is
very appropriate. It has a small bulb of numerous, roundish
scales. The pistils are often rudimentary.</p>

about an inch long, are usually single, but sometimes as
many as six on a stalk, various shades of yellow and
orange, tinged with crimson and fading to dull-red. The
smooth bulb is pure white, and made up of a number of
rounded, thickish scales not resembling grains of rice,
so the name Rice Root is not appropriate and the local
Utah names, Crocus, Snowdrop, and Buttercup are absurd.

<p>There are several kinds of Yucca, natives of North and
Central America; large plants, with dagger-like leaves,
usually with long, thread-like fibers along the margins;
flowers with bracts, nodding in a terminal cluster, somewhat
bell-shaped, with six, thickish, white divisions; stamens
short, with thickened filaments and small anthers; ovary
with three united stigmas; capsule containing many, flat,
black seeds. The flowers are pollinated by a little white
moth, which lays its eggs in the ovary, but previously
gathers pollen from many flowers and pushes it against
the stigma after the eggs have been laid.</p>

<p>A noble plant, with no trunk, but sending
up a magnificent shaft of flowers,
from five to fifteen feet tall, springing
from a huge, symmetrical bunch of dagger-like,
bluish-green leaves. The cluster is
composed of hundreds of waxy, cream-colored
blossoms, sometimes tinged with purple, two
inches across, crowded so closely together along the upper
part of the stalk that the effect is a great, solid mass of
bloom, three feet long. The white filaments are swollen,
tipped with pale-yellow anthers; the pistil cream-color,
with green stigmas. The large, white bracts are stiff and
coarse, something like parchment, folded back so that the
pinkish stalk is ornamented with a series of white triangles,
symmetrically arranged. A hillside covered with hundreds
of these magnificent spires of bloom, towering above
the chaparral, is a wonderful sight. After they have
blossomed, the tall, white stalks remain standing for
some time, so that the hills look as if they had been
planted with numbers of white wands.</p>

of the flower are very thick and there is no style.</p>

<p>A tree, grotesque and forbidding in
aspect, but with a weird sort of beauty,
looming black against the pale desert
landscape, with a great, thick, rough trunk,
fifteen to thirty feet high, and a few thick,

a giant's arms and pointing ominously
across the sandy waste. The branches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
are thatched with the shaggy husks of dead leaves and
from their tips they thrust out a great bunch of dagger-like
leaves and a big, ponderous cluster of pallid, greenish
flowers or heavy, yellowish fruits. The coarse flowers
are about two inches across, with a clammy smell like
toadstools, and the bracts are dead white. This grows
in the Mohave Desert and is at its best around Hesperia,
where one may see the most fantastic forest that it is
possible to imagine. Elsewhere it is smaller and more like
other Yuccas in shape. It was called Joshua Tree by the
early settlers, it is said because they fancied that its
branches pointed towards the Promised Land. The fruits
are relished by the Indians, who utilize the fibers from the
leaves for weaving baskets, ropes, hats, horse-blankets,
etc., and make a pulp from the stems, used for soap.</p>

exceedingly handsome, varying in color from dark-blue
to white, but usually deep, bright purplish-blue, with a
green ovary, a long purple style and yellow anthers, with
purple filaments. They are larger and handsomer in
northern California than in Yosemite. Grizzly bears are
fond of the bulbs and the Indians of the Northwest prized
them as a delicacy, indeed the Nez Percé war in Idaho
was caused by encroachments on a territory where they
were abundant. They were cooked elaborately in pits,
care being taken to avoid the poisonous bulbs of the Death
Camass, which resemble them. The Indians also boil
the bulbs in water and make good molasses from them,
which they use on festive occasions. This is sometimes
called Wild Hyacinth, but the name is poor, as it does not
resemble a hyacinth in character.

<p>There are six kinds of Clintonia, of North America and
Asia; with creeping rootstocks and a few, broad root-leaves;
flowers without bracts, their divisions separate,
equal or nearly so, each with a stamen at its base; style
with two or three, inconspicuous lobes; fruit a berry.
These plants were named in honor of De Witt Clinton,
Governor of New York, a naturalist, interested in botany,
so Thoreau need not have been so annoyed at their having
been given this name.</p>

and a tall, slightly downy flower-stalk,
usually with a few flowers scattered along
it, and crowned with a large, roundish cluster of beautiful
flowers. They are about three-quarters of an inch long,
very rich in color, a deep shade of warm reddish-pink, or
crimson, not common in flowers. The form of the cluster
varies a good deal; sometimes the flowers are not mostly
at the top, but clustered quite thickly along all the upper
part of the stalk. The large, deep-blue berries are very
handsome and, altogether, this is one of our most conspicuous
and attractive woodland plants, especially when
growing in the deep shade of redwood forests.</p>

<p>It is a pity that all flowers cannot have
really individual names. "False" is
especially unattractive and "Solomon's

alike, but this is the old name used all over
the world, so it will have to stand, though
unworthy of this pleasing plant. It is
from one to three feet high, with large,
light-green leaves, usually slightly downy
on the under side. The flower-cluster is sweet-scented and
composed of numerous, very small, cream-white flowers,
the conspicuous parts of which are the stamens, white and
larger than the petals, giving a feathery appearance to the
whole cluster. The fruit is a light-red berry, very finely

decorative and is common in rich moist woods. The name
was given in honor of Wagner.</p>

<p>Fairy Bells are graceful plants, growing in rich, moist,
mountain woods, with smoothish, or slightly hairy, branching
stems, leafy above and with scaly bracts below, springing
from slender root-stocks; leaves netted-veined, alternate,
without leaf-stalks, smooth and thin in texture and often
clasping the stem; rather small, bell-shaped flowers, hanging
from under the leaves, with six stamens and a slender
style, with one or three stigmas; the fruit a yellow or red
berry. <i>Disporum</i> is from the Greek meaning "double-seed,"
as in some kinds there are two seeds in each cell of
the ovary.</p>

<p>A very attractive mountain plant,
growing near streams. It is from nine to
twenty-four inches tall, with an angled
stem, pale green above and reddish below.
The delicate flowers, about half an inch
long, with a three-lobed green stigma and
yellow anthers, grow singly or in clusters of
two or three, nodding shyly under the pretty
leaves, which are dull above and very shiny on the under
side, with oddly crumpled edges and set obliquely on the
stem. The berry when unripe is orange color and suggested
the name Drops of Gold, but becomes bright red
when it matures in June. <i>D. Hookeri</i> is similar, but the
style is not three-lobed and the leaves are slightly rough
to the touch and are not so thin or crumpled. They
spread out so flat that they make a green roof over the
flowers, completely screening them from the passer-by.
This grows in shady woods, but not near streams.

<p>Perhaps the most characteristic western flowers are the
members of the genus Calochortus. They grow freely all
through the West, as far north as British America, and
down into Mexico, but they never get east of Nebraska, so
these gay and graceful flowers may be considered the peculiar
property of the West. Calochortus means "beautiful
grass" and the leaves are usually grasslike, the stems
slender and the flowers bright in color, decorative and interesting
in form. They have three sepals, often greenish,
and three large, colored petals, with a honey-gland, usually
covered with hairs, at the base of each. They are allied to
true Tulips, so the popular name is suitable, and they fall
into three groups: Globe Tulips, with nodding, globular
flowers, and nodding capsules; Star Tulips, with erect, star-like
flowers and nodding capsules; and Mariposa Tulips,
with large, somewhat cup-shaped flowers and erect capsules.
Mariposa means "butterfly" in Spanish and is
appropriate, for the brilliant hairy spots on the petals are
wonderfully like the markings of a butterfly's wing and the
airy blossoms seem to have but just alighted on the tips of
their slender stalks. They usually grow on dry open hillsides
and their leaves have often withered away before the
flowers bloom. The various forms run into each other, so
that it is impossible to determine all the different species.
They have solid bulbs, some of which are edible, considered
a delicacy by the Indians and called Noonas.</p>

<p>A charming plant, with pale bluish-green
foliage, with a beautiful "bloom,"
which sets off the clear-yellow blossoms to

flowers on each stem and the petals are
smooth, except for a neat, stiff fringe of
hairs along the margins and the matted
hairs on the glands, which are often reddish.
These lovely flowers, common in northern California,
are peculiarly fresh in color and when growing among the
grass in the shade of oak trees they have the springlike
charm of Daffodils in English woods.

<p>Beautiful and popular flowers, with a
great deal of individuality and quite
Japanese in the decorative arrangement of
the graceful stems and glossy, rich green
foliage. The narrow root-leaf is over a
foot long and spreads on the ground and
other smaller leaves are disposed along the bending stem,
which is from one to two feet tall and hung with pretty
light-green buds and beautiful drooping blossoms, over an
inch long, pearly white, sometimes tinged with lilac, with a
satiny sheen and delicate yet crisp in texture. The papery
sepals are greenish-white and the petals are sometimes
tinged with purple at the base and are prettily fringed with
hairs along the edges and often cross their tips in a very
engaging way. They are covered inside with long, silky,
white or yellow hairs and the glands are crescent-shaped,
with close, short, sticky, white or yellow hairs, and form
pale-green humps on the outside of the petals; the anthers
are cream-color and the pistil whitish. The capsule is one
or two inches long, with a short beak and brown seeds.
These plants grow on shady banks in the Coast Ranges and
have several pretty common names, such as Lantern of the
Fairies and Alabaster Tulip, as well as the misleading
name Hairbell, which causes this flower to be confused with
the Harebell or Campanula.</p>

<p>The commonest kind in northern California,
found in both the Sierra Nevada

beautiful of all the Mariposas. The broad
petals, each about an inch and a half long,
are usually white, lilac, or yellowish, with
an "eye" like that on a peacock's feather,
giving the name <i>oculatus</i>. Occasionally they are deep rose-color,
as in the colored picture, though this is not typical,
and have a vivid blotch of shaded maroon and crimson and
an orange spot on each petal, with some maroon-colored
hairs at the base. The sepals are striped with pink and
maroon and twist into spirals as they fade; the pistil and
the blunt anthers are mauve; the honey-gland narrowly
crescent-shaped; the leaves pale-green and the delicate
stem over a foot tall. This Mariposa is extremely variable
and seems sometimes to merge into <i>C. venústus</i>, a similar
kind, and gorgeous varieties of both may be seen along the
Yosemite road on the down grade to Wawona. There are
many similar Mariposas, but the casual flower-lover who
finds any of these beautiful flowers will probably be satisfied
to know that they are Butterfly Tulips, without going
into the technical peculiarities which differentiate them.</p>

slender stem, about a foot tall, often bears a small bulb near
the base. It is called Sego Lily (pronounced Sègo) in Utah

<h3 id="IRIS_FAMILY">IRIS FAMILY. <i>Iridaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, widely distributed and found throughout
our continent. Perennial herbs, with bracts; the leaves
long, narrow, toothless, and sheathing; the flowers showy,
perfect and regular, twisted in the bud, not falling off in
withering, of three and six parts; the three stamens on the
base of the sepals, their anthers turning outward; the
single style with three branches; the ovary inferior, becoming
a three-celled, usually three-angled, many-seeded
capsule. This family is noticeably distinguished from the
Lily family by the inferior ovary, and from the Amaryllis
family by the three stamens.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Iris. To the casual observer
the flowers appear to have nine petals of different sizes,
but in reality there are three sepals, three petals, and three
petal-like branches of the style. The three outer divisions,
or sepals, are large and spread or turn down; the three
inner divisions, or petals, are usually narrower and are
erect; the style branches arch over and under each is a
stamen. The sepals and petals have claws, which are
united below and form a tube; the capsule is large and
contains many, flat, black seeds, in one or two rows in
each cell; the large rootstock is usually fleshy. Iris is
from the Greek for "rainbow," in allusion to the variegated
tints, and Flower-de-luce from the French "fleur-de-lis," or
"lily-flower." Many odd and beautiful kinds are cultivated
from the Old World. Orris-root is made from the
roots of a Florentine species.</p>

<p>There are numerous kinds of Sisyrinchium, attractive
little plants, all American, many from South America;
with fibrous roots; grasslike leaves; slender, flat stems,
sometimes branching; papery and green bracts and pretty
flowers, that soon wither, on very slender pedicels, the six
spreading divisions all alike; the filaments of the stamens
united; the style branches slender, the capsule roundish,
containing round seeds.</p>

<p>The deep blue stars of this pretty plant
are a beautiful feature of the fields near
Santa Barbara, and in other parts of
California, in summer; in fact they are so
plentiful in some places that they are a
menace to the farmers. They grow in
clumps, about a foot tall, among the grass. The stems
are somewhat branching, the leaves are shorter than the
stem, and the bracts are about an inch long, green and
sheathing. There are about seven flowers on each stem, in
a loose cluster, each about an inch across and handsomer
than their relations in the East. They vary in tint from
bright blue to purple, with a yellow "eye," and their divisions
are prettily notched at the tips, with a little prong.
The anthers are arrow-shaped, the style short, with three
very small stigmas, and the small, oddly-shaped, little
capsule is dark-brown when ripe, and perhaps suggested
one of the common names, Nigger-babies. It is called
Azulea and Villela by Spanish-Californians.</p>

<p>This is very much like Blue-eyed Grass,
but the flowers are bright yellow, the
stems are about a foot tall, broadly winged
and not branching, and the leaves are
somewhat broader. The pretty flowers
are nearly an inch across and there are
from three to seven in a cluster. The
filaments are united at the base only, the style is cleft to
below the middle, and the small capsule is rather oblong.
This grows in swampy places near the ocean. <i>S. Arizònicum</i>
has yellow flowers and branching stems and grows in
Arizona. <i>S. Élmeri</i> also has yellow flowers, with purple
lines, and is found in wet places in the Sierras. When
pressed and dried the yellow-flowered Sisyrinchiums stain
the paper reddish-purple.

<h3 id="ORCHID_FAMILY">ORCHID FAMILY. <i>Orchidaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A very large family, most abundant in the tropics;
curious plants, with oddly beautiful flowers. Perhaps
because they are also rather rare they seem to have a
peculiar fascination for the public; in fact almost any
strangely-shaped flower is apt to be dubbed an orchid by
the passer-by. They are perennial herbs, with various
kinds of roots, some of them parasitic, usually with alternate,
toothless leaves, the lower ones sheathing the stem.
In some kinds the leaves have dwindled to scales. The
flowers are perfect, irregular, with six divisions; the three
sepals are alike and colored like petals; two of the three
petals are alike, but the central one differs in size and shape
and is called the lip. This is conspicuously colored, often
spurred, and contains nectar for the attraction of "long-tongued"
insects, on which these plants depend mostly for
cross-pollination. The mechanism for this purpose is
curious and interesting. The stigma is usually a broad
sticky surface and its style is united with the filaments and
forms, in front of the lip, a column which is usually capped
by a single two-celled anther, containing two clusters of
pollen, one in each cell. Each cluster consists of a few
waxy grains, held together by cobweb-like threads, which
run together and terminate in a sticky disk. These disks
adhere to the insects, which push in to get the nectar, and
are transported to the gummy stigma of another flower.
The inferior ovary develops into a three-valved capsule,
containing numerous minute seeds. Orchis is the ancient
Greek name.</p>

<p>There is only one kind of Cephalanthera in North America;
with creeping rootstocks; flowers in terminal spikes, with
bracts; sepals and petals nearly equal; petals somewhat
united and hooded; lip more or less pouched.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Phantom Orchis</b><br />

<p>In dense mountain forests these strange
plants shimmer like pallid ghosts among
the dark trees. They are pure translucent
white throughout, stem and all, and the
leaves have shrunk to white sheaths, an
inch or two long. The stems are one to
two feet tall and bear spikes of numerous flowers, each over
half an inch long, with the lip shorter than the sepals and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
petals, which are alike. They are beautiful and yet not
quite pleasing, for we feel instinctively that there is something
unnatural about them and, indeed, the strange
absence of any green coloring matter in their make-up
indicates that they are incapable of making their own
food from the elements and draw their nourishment from
decaying vegetation, or are parasitic on other plants.
They range northward from Yosemite but are nowhere
very abundant. I found several growing near the trail
from Little Yosemite Valley to Cloud's Rest and a good
many in the woods near the foot of Mt. Shasta, where they
seem to be quite common.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Serapias, widely distributed;
tall, stout herbs, with creeping rootstocks and leafy stems;
the leaves plaited lengthwise and clasping at base; the
flowers with leafy bracts, in terminal racemes. The
flowers have no spur; the sepals and petals are separate
and nearly equal; the lip broad, free, concave below,
constricted near the middle.</p>

<p>A handsome plant, decorative and
curious in form and unusual in coloring.
It is from one to four feet tall, with a stout,
leafy stem bearing three to ten flowers and
smoothish leaves, with prominent veins.
The sepals are reddish or greenish-yellow
and the petals pinkish, veined with
maroon. The lip is pouched at the base,
with a winged margin and a pendulous tip, which swings
freely as if on a hinge, so that it quivers when the plant is
shaken. Although the flowers are very handsome this
curious tremulous motion, which makes them seem almost
alive, gives them a quaint likeness to an old woman in a
sunbonnet, with a hooked nose and chattering jaw. They
have a slight scent and the plant is quite common along
streams and in wet places, in the West and in Colorado and
Texas. Some botanists think it is identical with a variety
which grows in the Himalaya Mountains. It was named
for the Egyptian deity, Serapis.

<p>There are several kinds of Corallorrhiza, widely distributed
in the north temperate zone and growing in dense
woods; pinkish or straw-colored plants, more or less
parasitic, with large roots resembling branches of coral;
the leaves all reduced to sheathing, papery scales; the
flowers in terminal racemes, without bracts, on short
pedicels, which turn down in fruit, mostly with a short
spur, the sepals and petals about equal, the upper ones
curving in.</p>

<p>The curious knobby rootstock, shaped
like a bit of coral, gives the name to this
strange and rather unwholesome looking
plant. From living on decayed vegetation
it has lost its green leaves, and has only a
few papery sheaths in their place, and the
thick, translucent stem is pale and smooth,
from one to two feet tall, pink at the base, shading to
golden-brown towards the top. The flowers, less than
half an inch across, are usually yellow, with reddish-brown
tips, and the white, three-lobed lip is spotted with purple.
The buds are yellow and brown and the whole color effect
is very pretty, as if the plant were trying to match the
russet tints of the floor of the forest. The flowers vary
from several to many and grow in a long cluster, hanging
down when their seeds begin to ripen. This is widely
distributed, growing also in the East, but nowhere common.</p>

<p>This is a similar plant, but handsomer,
with much larger flowers, duller in coloring
and striped not spotted. Instead of a
spur the base of the sepals is swollen over
the ovary, which develops gradually into
an oblong fruit to which the flower still
clings, so that the older flowers, on the
lower part of the stalk, give an odd effect of having long,
swollen necks. The seeds are small and numerous.
There are other kinds, similar in general effect.

<p>Often in some favorable corner of a
marsh, near the woods, we may see a
dozen of these lovely plants, their robust
leafy stalks sometimes as much as four
feet tall, rearing their delicate spires of
bloom above the lush grass. The long
narrow leaves are bright-green and
smooth and the numerous, small, delicate blossoms,
sprinkled thickly along the stem, are pure white, each with
a very long spur like a little tail, each with a green bract
at the base of its little pedicel, and deliciously fragrant.
There are several similar kinds, mostly with green flowers;
this is the handsomest and least rare.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Cypripedium, with large, broad
leaves and one or several, large, drooping flowers, with two
fertile anthers, with short filaments, one on each side of
the column below the stigma, and a conspicuous, petal-like,
sterile anther, arching over the stigma. They are
easily known by the curious lip, which is a large inflated
sac, suggesting both the common names, Lady's Slipper
and Indian Moccasin, and the Greek, meaning "foot of
Venus."</p>

lip about an inch long, dull-white, veined
with purple, and brownish or purplish
sepals and petals, very long, narrow, and
twisted. This grows in mountain woods and is found
around Yosemite. There is a picture in Miss Parsons's
<i>Wild Flowers of California</i>. <i>C. Califórnicum</i> is similar, but
with more flowers, the sepals and petals greenish-yellow,
the lip pinkish. <i>C. parviflòrum</i> has a yellow lip and
purplish sepals and grows in northern woods, across the
continent. None of these plants is common.

<h3 id="LIZARD-TAIL">LIZARD-TAIL. <i>Saururaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A small family; ours are perennial astringent herbs, with
alternate, toothless leaves, with leaf-stalks; flowers perfect,
with bracts, in a dense, terminal spike, without calyx or
corolla; stamens generally three or six; ovary with one to
five stigmas; fruit a capsule or berry.</p>

<p>This plant bears several, large, cream-white
flowers, which at the first glance
appear to have from five to eight petals
and a long, projecting knob in the center,
but what appears to be a corolla is in
reality an involucre, about an inch and a
half across, and surrounding the base of a long, conical
spike of numerous, small, greenish flowers. These are
half-sunk in the fleshy substance of the spike and have no
sepals or petals, but each has a small, white bract at its
base, so that the spike appears to be covered with scales
symmetrically arranged. The flower has from six to eight
stamens on the base of the ovary and from three to four
stigmas. The ovaries, which are superior, form small pods,
opening at the top when ripe, so that in the end the spike
is neatly pitted with holes. The rather thick, hollow,
reddish stems are from six inches to two feet tall, covered
with hair, and the smooth, light-green leaves, from two to
ten inches long, are mostly from the root, with leaf-stalks
which broaden at the base and partly sheathe the
stem. The creeping rootstocks are peppery and acrid,
used medicinally, and considered exceedingly valuable by
Spanish-Californians. These pretty, odd-looking plants
grow in alkaline or salty swamps in the south. The name
is from the Greek meaning "anemone" and "appearance,"
but the flowers do not look very much like Anemones.</p>

<h3 id="SANDALWOOD_FAMILY">SANDALWOOD FAMILY. <i>Santalaceae.</i></h3>

<p>This is a very small family in this country, for they
prefer the tropics, and in those regions some are trees.
Ours are usually parasitic on the roots of their neighbors.
They have toothless, mostly alternate leaves, mostly
without leaf-stalks or stipules, and small flowers, with a
four- or five-lobed calyx and no corolla. The four or five
stamens are opposite the calyx lobes, at the edge of a
fleshy disk, and the ovary is one-celled and inferior, with
one style, developing into a one-seeded fruit.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of Comandra, one of them European;
smooth, perennial herbs, with alternate leaves, and flowers
in clusters, without bracts. The calyx is more or less
bell-shaped, usually with five lobes, its tube lined with a
disk, the stamens inserted at base of the lobes and the
anthers attached to the lobes by tufts of hairs.</p>

pale-green, smooth, slightly thickish,
rather stiff leaves, which are reduced to
pinkish scales on the lower stem. The
flowers are small, usually flesh-color,
thickish in texture, with slender pedicels, and form terminal,
rather flat-topped clusters. The fruit, which is
about the size of a small pea, is crowned by the remains of
the calyx, like a rose-hip. This is common on dry plains
and hillsides and is noticeable because of its pale and
somewhat peculiar coloring.</p>

without stipules; the flowers perfect, mostly large, symmetrical
or irregular in form, with or without a corolla; the
calyx with three or six lobes, or irregular; the stamens six

<p>The handsome leaves of this perennial
are its conspicuous feature. They have
long, hairy leaf-stalks and are heart-shaped
and toothless, from three to five
inches broad, dark rich green, prettily
veined and often also beautifully mottled with white,
smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the under. We
notice them immediately in the damp, dark woods they
live in, but unless we look carefully we miss the single,
large, strange, purplish-brown flower, the color of dead
leaves, which nestles close to the ground as if trying to
hide itself. This has twelve stamens, with stout filaments,
and six styles, united at the base. There are no petals,
but the hairy calyx has three lobes, which are sometimes
an inch and a half long, and have long points like tails.
The seed-vessel is roundish, crowned by the withered
calyx and stamens. The rootstock cannot be used as a
substitute for ginger, but smells and tastes very aromatic
and pungent. This resembles the Wild Ginger of the
East, but is handsomer.</p>

<h3 id="BUCKWHEAT_FAMILY">BUCKWHEAT FAMILY. <i>Polygonaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, widely distributed, mostly herbs or low
shrubs, with toothless leaves, often with stipules sheathing
the swollen joints of the stem. The small flowers have no
petals, the calyx usually resembles a corolla and has from
three to six divisions. There are from four to nine stamens
and a superior, mostly triangular, ovary, with two or three
styles or stigmas, becoming a dry, one-seeded fruit, generally
brown or black. The kind from which flour is made is
cultivated from northern Asia, and the name Buckwheat,
from the German, means "beech-wheat," because the
grain resembles minute beech-nuts. There are several
common "weeds" belonging to this family, such as Dock,
Sorrel, and Smartweed.</p>

<p>Chorizanthes are low herbs, with branching stems,
without stipules, the leaves forming a rosette at the base
and withering early. The small flowers have six sepals
and are clustered in small heads, usually one flower in each
papery involucre, which has from two to six teeth, with
bristles at the tips; stamens usually nine, on the base of the
perianth; styles three, with round-top stigmas.</p>

abruptly and widely towards the top
and bearing many small flowers. The involucres are
deep-red or purple, with very prickly teeth, the sepals
bright-pink, prettily fringed with white and striped with
deeper color, and the filaments are long and threadlike,
with purple anthers. The flowers are exceedingly pretty
when closely examined, though too small to be very effective,
but the plant as a whole is conspicuous both in color

<p>There are many kinds of Rumex, or Dock, coarse herbs,
with leafy, branching, grooved stems, sheathed with conspicuous,
papery stipules, strong tap-roots and acid or
bitter juice. The large leaves are alternate, with smooth
or wavy edges; the flowers small, greenish or reddish, on
jointed pedicels, in branching clusters; the stamens six;
the styles three, the stigmas shield-shaped, with a tuft of
hairs at the tip. The six divisions of the flower are in two
sets, the three outer small and green, the inner ones larger,
colored and becoming veiny and larger in fruit, forming
valves or wings, (often with a grain on the back of one or
all of them,) which closely cover the three-sided fruit.
These wings make the fruits of Docks more conspicuous
than the flower. The Latin name comes from a word
meaning "to suck," because the Romans sucked the leaves
to allay thirst.</p>

about a foot tall, with a smooth, stout
reddish stem and smooth, pale, blue-green
leaves, that feel like thin rubber, with a
prominent mid-vein front and back. The small inconspicuous
flowers develop into clusters of showy valves or
wings, wonderfully odd and beautiful in coloring, resembling
Begonia flowers. At first these wings are pale green,
but they gradually brighten until they are all shades of
salmon, rose-color, and red, fading to brown, and forming
lovely combinations of vivid color, particularly against the
arid background of the sand hills they frequent, and they
last a long time in water and are exceedingly decorative.
If these wings, which are nearly an inch across, are pulled
apart, a three-sided akene, like a little nut, will be found
inside them.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Eriogonum, herbs or shrubs,
natives of America, mostly western, growing in dry places,
very numerous and difficult to distinguish. The leaves,
without sheaths or stipules, are often covered with white
down and usually grow in a spreading cluster at the base of
the stem. The numerous small flowers, on very slender
little pedicels, have six sepals, thin in texture and usually
colored, and form clusters of various shapes, which emerge
from more or less bell-shaped or top-shaped involucres,
with six teeth. There are nine stamens, with threadlike
filaments, often hairy, and a three-parted style with round-top

spiny and crowded with small, alternate,
toothless leaves, pale-green and thickish,

and the branches become loaded with beautifully shaded
bunches of these curious seed-vessels, giving a strange,

<h3 id="FOUR-OCLOCK_FAMILY">FOUR-O'CLOCK FAMILY. <i>Nyctaginaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A rather large family, widely distributed, most abundant
in America. Ours are herbs, often succulent, with
no stipules; stems often fragile, swollen at the joints;
leaves opposite, usually toothless, often unequal; flowers
perfect, with no petals, but the calyx colored like a corolla,
with four or five lobes or teeth, and more or less funnel-shaped;
one or several flowers in a cluster with an involucre;
stamens three to five, with slender filaments;
style one, with a round-top stigma; the green base of the
calyx drawn down around the ovary, making it appear
inferior, and hardening into a nutlike fruit; seeds sometimes
winged.</p>

<p>Quamoclidions have the odd habit of opening in the
afternoon, hence the common name, Four-o'clock. The
flowers usually have five stamens, and are grouped several
together in a cluster, which emerges from an involucre
so much resembling a calyx that it is often mistaken for one.
The effect is of the flowers having clubbed together and
made one calyx do for the lot. The fruit is hard, smooth,
and roundish.</p>

<p>The leaves of this low, stout, and spreading

rather rough and coarse, and the stems
are often hairy and sticky. The foliage
contrasts strikingly in color with the
gaudy pink or magenta flowers, an inch
across and slightly sweet-scented, the shape of Morning-glories
and resembling them, as they have the same stripes
of deeper color. The long stamens droop to one side, the
pistil is long and purple and the bell-shaped involucre
contains about six flowers. These plants are conspicuous
and quite handsome. They grow on the plateau in the
Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Hesperonia, much like Quamoclidion,

drop, which they do very soon, this involucre unfolds and
expands until it becomes an exceedingly thin, papery,

exude a watery juice, which is said to be alkaline and
injurious to shoe-leather. The stems and leaves are light
bright-green, the tips and margins tinged with bright
pinkish-red, especially on dry mesas, where this plant
sometimes covers the ground for long distances with flat
rosettes, forming a thick, red carpet, beautiful in color.

<p>A very strange and conspicuous plant,
often clothing sandy slopes with a curious
mantel of trailing, fleshy stems and
foliage thickly sprinkled with thousands
of gaudy flowers. The stems are stout
and flattish, several feet long; the leaves
three-sided, with flat faces, tipped with a
small reddish point; the calyx-lobes three-sided like the
leaves. The stems, leaves, and the calyx-lobes are all pale
bluish-green with a "bloom" and exceedingly succulent,
the watery juice running out in large drops when the plant
is broken. The twigs seem to be fitted into a sort of
socket, from which they come out very easily, so that the
plant comes apart almost at a touch. The fragrant
flowers are two or three inches across, bright but crude
in color, the numerous, purplish-pink petals resembling
the rays of a composite and encircling a fuzzy ring of
innumerable stamens, with white, threadlike filaments
and small, straw-colored anthers, around a dark-green
center, composed of the top of the calyx and the six to ten
styles of the ovary. This accommodating plant is very
useful and ornamental in hot, sandy places, where not
much else will grow, and may be seen hanging its long stems
over the sea-cliffs all along the coast, from Patagonia to
Marin County in California. It also grows in Africa and
is extensively cultivated. The fruit is edible, with pulp
and tiny seeds something like a fig.

<h3 id="PINK_FAMILY">PINK FAMILY. <i>Caryophyllaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, widely distributed, most abundant in
the northern hemisphere, including both the handsome
Pinks and the insignificant Chickweeds. They are herbs,
with regular, mostly perfect flowers, with four or five sepals;
usually with four or five petals, sometimes with none;
stamens as many, or twice as many, as the petals; ovary
superior, one-celled; styles two to five in number; fruit a
capsule, containing several or many, kidney-shaped seeds,
opening by valves, or by teeth, at the top; leaves opposite,
toothless; stems usually swollen at the joints. The name
Pink comes from the petals of some kinds being cut into
points, or "pinked."</p>

<p>There are numerous kinds of Arenaria, widely distributed,
difficult to distinguish, with small, white flowers
with five petals, usually not notched, ten stamens and
usually three styles; leaves usually long and narrow, often
stiff and growing in tufts; capsule roundish, splitting into
usually three valves, each with two parts. These plants
often grow in dry, sandy places, some at very high altitudes,
some by the sea, hence the Latin name meaning "sandy,"
and the common one, Sandwort.</p>

<p>This has pretty little white flowers,
about half an inch across, and is variable.
Sometimes the stem is roughish, only
three or four inches tall, springing from a
tuft of small leaves, stiff and almost
prickly. Sometimes the stem is smooth,
six or eight inches tall, and the leaves resemble rather fine,
stiff grass. This grows on dry hills and mountains, up to
thirteen thousand feet, from Nebraska and Wyoming to
Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Silene, widely distributed,
more or less sticky plants, hence the common name,
Catchfly; flowers mostly rather large; calyx inflated or
tubular, with five teeth; petals five, with long claws, which
often have scales at the top, forming a "crown"; stamens
ten; styles usually three; capsule opening by three or six
teeth at the tip; seeds numerous.

The flowers are even more brilliant in color
than <i>S. laciniata</i> and are startlingly beautiful, glowing
like coals of fire on the brown forest floor, in the open
mountain woods they usually frequent. It is widely
distributed in the Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada

beautiful large pink flowers, often more than two inches
across, sometimes white, and grows on shady hillsides in
the Northwest, except in Idaho.

<h3 id="PURSLANE_FAMILY">PURSLANE FAMILY. <i>Portulacaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A rather small family, mostly American; herbs, usually
with thick, succulent leaves and stems, with flowers opening
only in sunlight. They usually have only two sepals,
but the petals number from two to five or more; the stamens
are sometimes numerous, but when they are of the
same number as the petals they are opposite them; the
one-celled ovary is superior, becoming a many-seeded
capsule. Pusley, or Purslane, is one of the commonest
garden weeds; everybody knows how difficult it is to keep
the spreading rosettes out of gravel walks, and we are all
familiar with the gaudy, ephemeral flowers of the cultivated
Portulaca. The Purslane-tree, or Spek-boom, of
South Africa is often the principal food of elephants and
its foliage gives the characteristic coloring to the landscape.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Montia, closely related to
Claytonia, mostly natives of North America, rather
succulent plants, very smooth and often with a "bloom."
The flowers are white or pinkish, with two sepals; the five
petals, equal or somewhat unequal, separate or more or
less united at base; the stamens five or three; the style
branches three; the capsule with three valves and one to
three, shiny, black seeds, which when ripe are shot out of
the capsule by the elastic closing of the valves.</p>

<p>The Indians gather these pretty succulent
little plants for salad and indeed the
tender, bright-green leaves look as if they
would taste very nice. They grow in a
loose bunch, with several stems, a few
inches to a foot high. The root-leaves have long leaf-stalks
and vary very much in size and shape, the earliest
being long and narrow, like little green tongues, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
later ones oval, round and kidney-shaped, and they vary
also in tint, in dry places being sometimes a dull yellowish-pink.
The stem-leaves are quite odd, for a single pair
have united around the stem and become a circular or
somewhat two-lobed disk, one or two inches broad, the
stalk piercing right through its center. This leaf forms a
pretty, shallow saucer, with a small, loose cluster of tiny
flowers, on slender flower-stalks, springing from the middle.
This is common everywhere in orchards or vineyards, and
in shady places in the foothills and canyons, and has long
been cultivated in England for salad. It is also called
Indian Lettuce and Squaw Cabbage. <i>M. perfoliàta</i> is
similar.</p>

<p>Sandy spots in the mountains are often
brightened by lovely patches of the soft
pink blooms of this attractive and odd-looking
little plant. Near Wawona, on
the Glacier Point trail, I saw at least half
an acre of sand carpeted with beautiful
rose-color. In moderate altitudes the
plants are about ten inches tall, but they get dwarfish as
they climb and on the mountain-tops they are only an
inch or so high, with close mats of small leaves. They
have strong tap-roots and the leaves are dull gray-green,
rather thick and stiff but hardly succulent, and grow
mostly in rosettes at the base, those on the stem having
shrunk to mere bracts, with several, smooth, reddish
stalks springing from among them. Each stem bears a
close, roundish head, two or three inches across, consisting
of many tightly-coiled tufts of shaded pink, each composed
of innumerable, small, pink flowers, the papery, pink and
white sepals and bracts being the most conspicuous part.
They overlap each other and have daintily ruffled edges.
The three stamens are long and protruding and the style
long and threadlike. The flower-clusters are like soft
pink cushions, so the pretty little name of Pussy-paws is
appropriate, both to form and coloring. Chipmunks are
very fond of the small, black seeds.</p>

<h3 id="BUTTERCUP_FAMILY">BUTTERCUP FAMILY. <i>Ranunculaceae.</i></h3>

<p>The members of this large and handsome family vary so
much in appearance that it is difficult for the amateur to
realize that they are nearly related. In fact they have no
very distinctive characteristics. They are all herbs,
except Clematis, which is shrubby, and all have bitter
juice, which is never milky or colored, numerous stamens
and usually several pistils, which are superior and one-celled,
bearing a single style, and all the parts of the flower
are separate from each other and inserted on the receptacle.
The flowers are often of eccentric forms, with spurs or
hoods; sometimes they dispense with petals altogether
and instead have colored sepals which resemble petals.
The leaves are of all sorts and shapes, usually more or less
lobed and cut, but have no stipules and often their bases
clasp the stem. The fruit is an akene, pod, or berry.
Many of our most beautiful and popular garden flowers
are included in this family, which is large and distributed
throughout the world, but not abundant in the tropics.</p>

<p>There are numerous kinds of Ranunculus, mostly
perennials, with fibrous roots, growing in temperate and
cold regions. Ours have yellow or white flowers, with
three to five sepals and from three to fifteen petals, each
of the petals with a nectar-gland at its base; the numerous
pistils developing into a roundish or oblong head of akenes.
The leaves are variously cut and lobed, the stem leaves
alternate. Some sorts grow in the water and some have
creeping stems. Some kinds of Ranunculus are liable to
be confused with some sorts of Cinquefoils, but the calyx of a
Buttercup has no bractlets, as has that of a Cinquefoil. The
Latin name means "little frog," as these plants like marshes.</p>

<p>The commonest kind are attractive,
often coloring the fields for miles with
bright gold, but the flowers are not so
pretty as some common eastern kinds.
The stems are branching and more or less
hairy, nine inches to a foot and a half tall,
with dark-green leaves, smooth, hairy or
velvety, and velvety, hairy buds. The
flowers are about an inch across, with from nine to sixteen,
bright-yellow, shiny petals and pale-green sepals, turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
closely back. The akenes have hooked beaks. This runs

<p>Few flowers are more beautiful and interesting in color
and construction than Larkspurs. We are all familiar
with their tall spires of oddly-shaped blossoms, growing in
gardens, and we find them even more charming in their
natural surroundings, glowing like sapphires on desert
sands, or adorning mountain woods with patches of vivid
color. There are many kinds; ours are perennials, with
palmately-divided leaves and usually blue or white flowers,
very irregular in form, with five sepals, resembling petals,
the upper one prolonged into a spur at the back, and
usually four petals, two of which are small and inside the
calyx-spur, the larger two partly covering the pistils and
the numerous stamens. The pistils, from one to five, become
many-seeded pods. Some Larkspurs are poisonous
to cattle. The Latin name is from a fancied resemblance
of the flower to the dolphin of decorative art. Spanish
Californians call it Espuela del caballero, Cavalier's spur.</p>

extremely pretty. In the Grand Canyon,

twelve flowers in a cluster. They measure
nearly an inch across and are brilliant and iridescent in
coloring, as except for two small whitish petals, they are the
deepest, brightest blue, exquisitely tinted with violet, with
brown anthers. At Tucson, among the rocks above the
Desert Laboratory, it grows to over a foot in height, with a
cluster over six inches long and light dull-green leaves,
slightly stiff and thick, with long leaf-stalks, the lobes
tipped with a bristle, forming a handsome clump. This
grows on dry plains and rocky hillsides, up to seven thousand
feet. The picture is from a Grand Canyon plant.</p>

<p>If the flowers were a little less pale in
color this would be a gorgeous plant, for
it sometimes grows nearly four feet high.
The branching stem springs from a
cluster of thick, tapering roots, each
branch terminating in a long, crowded
cluster of twenty or thirty flowers, opalescent in tint,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
either white, with a bluish or greenish spot on the tip of
each sepal, or very pale pink, with a purplish or bluish
spot. The dull, yellowish-green leaves are rather thickish

<p>A splendid flower when at its best,
from six inches to a foot and a half tall,
with a smooth stem, reddish below, and
smooth, bright-green leaves, pale on the
under side, round in general outline, the
lower ones with long, reddish leaf-stalks
sheathing the stem, the roots thick but not tuberous.
The beautiful flowers are sometimes an inch and a half
across, on long, rather spreading pedicels, few or many, in
a long loose cluster, the buds slightly downy. The general
effect of the flowers is deep bright-blue, but when we
examine them more closely we find that the slightly
woolly spurs are purplish, the blue sepals have on the back
protuberances, which are pinkish on the front and greenish
on the back, the two, small, upper petals are white,
delicately striped with purple, and the lower ones, which
are fuzzy with tufts of white down and two-cleft, are deep
pinkish-purple; sometimes the whole flower is much paler
in color. The anthers are large and green at first, becoming
small and yellow, their threadlike filaments curling.
This grows on dry hills. <i>D. Párryi</i>, of California, is about
two feet tall, similar in coloring, but even handsomer, with
a cluster nearly a foot long, closely crowded with beautiful
flowers, each an inch and a half across. The lower leaves
are slashed nearly to the center, into seven divisions, each
with three, long, narrow lobes.</p>

<p>Scarlet seems an odd color for a Larkspur,
but there are two red ones in the
West. This is an exceedingly airy,
graceful plant and suggests a Columbine
more than a Larkspur. The stem is
slender and branching, from one to over
two feet tall, with a "bloom"; the leaves
thickish, smooth, dark rich green on the upper side and
pale on the under. The flowers are far apart, from two to
twelve, on long pedicels, forming a very loose, open cluster.
Each flower is about an inch long; the sepals scarlet
shading to yellow, the spur tipped with deeper red, the
petals yellow tipped with crimson, not woolly, the two
upper notched and much larger than the two lower ones,
which are small and slashed into two points, the edges of
both sepals and petals more or less hairy; the buds pale
yellowish-green, tinged with pink and red. These charming
flowers have an elfin look all their own, as they swing
their little pointed red caps in the light shade of cool
canyons along the mountain streams they love. In
southern California we find <i>D. cardinàle</i>, a handsomer
plant, sometimes six feet tall, its flowers larger and deeper
red and forming a larger, closer cluster.

<p>The picturesque Columbine gets its melodious name
from the Latin for "dove," because the spurs suggest a
circle of pretty little pigeons, and this common name is
less far-fetched than the Latin one, Aquilegia, which comes
from a fancied resemblance of the spurs to an eagle's claws.
These plants are well known and easily recognized by the
peculiar shape of the flowers. Everything about them is
decorative and beautiful, the foliage is pretty and the
flowers large, brightly colored, and conspicuous. They
are all perennials, with branching stems and compound
leaves; the flowers usually nodding, with five sepals all
alike and resembling petals, and five petals, also all alike,
with conspicuous, hollow spurs. The stamens, the inner
ones without anthers, are numerous and the five pistils
develop into a head of five, erect, many-seeded pods.
There is honey in the spurs, which can be reached only
by "long-tongued" insects or humming birds, which thus
assist in cross-pollination, and bees obviate the difficulty
of having short tongues by ingeniously cutting holes in
the spurs. There are a good many beautiful kinds, both
East and West.</p>

<p>Monkshoods have almost as much charm as their cousins
Columbine and Larkspur, with a quaintness and individuality
all their own. There are a good many kinds;
mountain plants, growing in temperate regions, with
rather weak stems and leaves much like those of Larkspur.
The blue and white blossoms have a "hood," which gives
these plants their very appropriate name. This is formed
by the upper and larger one of the five, petal-like sepals
arching over and forming a hood, or helmet, under which
the two small petals, with spurs and claws, are hidden;
sometimes there are three or more petals below, which are
minute and resemble stamens. The real stamens are
numerous and ripen before the pistils, thus ensuring cross-pollination,
and the fruit consists of a head, of from three to
five, many-seeded pods. The thick or turnip-shaped root
is used medicinally and is virulently poisonous, so these
plants are sometimes called Wolfsbane. Aconite is the
ancient Greek name and other common names are Blue-weed
and Friar's-cap.</p>

from almost white to deep-blue, veined with purple.
They are paler inside and grow on slender pedicels, in a
long loose cluster, on a somewhat bending stem. The
two, small, hammer-shaped petals are nearly concealed
under the hood. The leaves are alternate, the lower ones
with long leaf-stalks, and deeply cleft into three or five,
toothed or lobed, divisions. This reaches an altitude of

<p>There are two kinds of Peony. This is a
robust and very decorative perennial, rich
and unusual in coloring, the fine foliage setting
off the dark flowers to perfection. The
roots are woody, the stems smooth, from
eight inches to a foot and a half tall, and the leaves are
smooth, rich green, but not shiny. The nodding flowers
are an inch and a half across, with five or six greenish-purple
sepals, five or six petals, rich deep-red, tinged and
streaked with yellow and maroon; dull-yellow stamens and
green pistils. The whole flower is quite thick and leathery
in texture and rather coarse, sometimes so dark that it is
almost black. The flowers are often fragrant, but the
plant has a disagreeable smell, something like Skunk-cabbage,
when crushed. The large seed-pods, usually five,
are thick, leathery and smooth, with several seeds and are
a very conspicuous feature, the stems drooping as they
ripen and the pods resting on the ground in big bunches.
The whole plant is rather succulent and the foliage and
stems are more or less tinged with red and have a "bloom,"
especially on the sepals. This grows in all sorts of places,
in the hot plains of the south and at the edge of the snow, in
northern, mountain canyons. In the south it blooms in
January and is sometimes called Christmas-rose. The
root is used medicinally by the Spanish-Californians and
by the Indians, "to give their horses long wind." These
plants were named in honor of Paion, the physician of the
gods.</p>

<p>There are only a few kinds of Actaea, tall perennials,
with large, alternate, thrice-compound leaves and small,
white flowers, in short, terminal clusters. The sepals
number about four and resemble petals; the petals are
from four to ten, or sometimes none, with claws; the
stamens are numerous, with conspicuous white filaments;
the one pistil has a broad, somewhat two-lobed, stigma, and
the fruit is a large, showy, red or white, somewhat poisonous
berry, containing many, smooth, flat seeds.</p>

feet tall, with a stoutish, smooth, branching
stem and handsome leaves, prettily
cut, with pointed teeth, thin and soft in
texture, with conspicuous veins. The
sepals and petals of the small cream-white flowers are less
conspicuous than the numerous white stamens, which give
a very feathery appearance to the flower-cluster, which is
one or two inches long and speckled with the dark tips of
the pistils. The sepals and petals drop off early and the
stamens lengthen, so that the cluster becomes very airy
and delicate. The general effect of the plant, which grows
near shady mountain streams, is striking and graceful.
It grows also in the East and is sometimes slightly sweet-scented,
but often has an unpleasant smell. The handsome,
poisonous berries are oval or round, red or white,
with a polished surface, and contain many seeds. This
reaches an altitude of ten thousand feet. A very similar
kind, <i>A. viridiflòra</i>, grows in the mountains of Arizona.</p>

when found growing in the snow, or
near the edge of a field of melting ice, in
high mountains and along the margins of
glaciers. The handsome, toothed leaves are palmately-lobed
or divided, the lower ones with long leaf-stalks, rich
green and glossy and setting off the flowers, which grow
singly at the tips of smooth, rather weak stems, from one to
two feet tall, and measure about an inch and a half across.
The sepals, from five to seven in number, are large, cream-white,
slightly greenish outside, and are the conspicuous
part of the flower, for the petals are very small and yellow,
so that they resemble stamens. From fifteen to twenty-five
of these little petals, in a row, surround the numerous,
real stamens and form a beautiful golden center. The
fruit is a head, measuring an inch across, composed of
eight to fifteen small pods, with beaks, containing many,
smooth, oblong seeds. This plant looks very much like
an Anemone but it has these small yellow petals and
Anemones have none, and the center is larger and brighter
yellow and the foliage coarser.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of Clematis, or Virgin's Bower,
familiar to us all, both East and West, and general favorites,
widely distributed and flourishing in temperate regions;
perennials, woody below, which is unusual in this family.
Usually they are beautiful trailing vines, which climb over
bushes and rocks, holding on by their twisting, curling
leaf-stalks. The flowers have no petals, or only very
small ones, but their sepals, usually four, resemble petals;
the stamens are numerous. The numerous pistils form a
round bunch of akenes, their styles developing into long
feathery tails, and these gray, plumy heads are very
conspicuous and ornamental, when the flowers are gone.
The leaves are opposite, which is unusual in this family,
with slender leaf-stalks, and are usually compound. Some
plants have only staminate flowers and some only pistillate
ones, and the appearance is quite different, the flowers with
stamens being handsomer.</p>

and resemble small petals. The flowers are followed by
handsome feathery heads, which are large and silky. This
pretty vine is found in the Grand Canyon, not far below the
Rim, and in many mountain places. The foliage varies
somewhat in different climates.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Thalictrum, not easily distinguished,
widely distributed, a few in the Andes, India,
and Africa; perennials, with tall stems, from a short rootstock,
and handsome, compound leaves; the flowers perfect
or imperfect, many, small, in clusters, with four to seven
sepals and no petals; the akenes tipped with the long styles
and forming a head. Some of these plants have a disagreeable
smell. They grow in moist places, both East and West.</p>

<p>Though its flowers are small and colorless,
this plant is conspicuous for delicacy
and grace. The leaves of tender green
suggest the fronds of Maidenhair Fern
and are almost as beautiful, while the
flowers are odd and pretty. A shower of
numerous, pale-yellow stamens, with purplish, threadlike
filaments, falls from the center of four, greenish-white
sepals and forms a charming little tassel. These tassels
hang on the ends of very slender pedicels, in loose clusters.
The smooth stems are from one to three feet tall and the
smooth leaves are thin in texture, thrice-compound, with
many, rounded leaflets, the lower leaves with long leaf-stalks.
This Meadow Rue has its pistils and stamens on
different plants, the flowers with tassels of stamens being
prettier and more conspicuous than the small, green, pistillate
ones. The variety <i>Wrìghtii</i> is common in Arizona.

<h3 id="BARBERRY_FAMILY">BARBERRY FAMILY. <i>Berberidaceae.</i></h3>

<p>Not a large family, widely distributed; shrubs or herbs;
leaves alternate or from the root; flowers perfect; sepals
and petals few, many, or none, generally in several overlapping
rows; stamens on the receptacle, usually as many
as the petals and opposite them; pistil one, with a short

Wash., Oreg., Cal.</b></div>

<p>A charming woodland plant, its airy
flower cluster, which has much the effect
of an Alum-root, in beautiful contrast to
the crisp, evergreen foliage. The large
leaves are all from the root, with wiry,
purplish leaf-stalks and beautifully-shaped
leaflets, each an inch or more broad, pale
on the under side, the older leaves dark, rich green, leathery
and very glossy and the younger ones bright apple-green
and thinner in texture. They form a handsome cluster,
varying a good deal in size, and the general effect suggests
some very crisp and sturdy sort of Maidenhair Fern.
The stem is from one to two feet tall, wiry, purplish, and
hairy, and bears a very loose cluster of tiny, drooping,
white or lilac-tinged flowers. The six, white sepals
resemble petals; the six, white petals are smaller than the
sepals, lined with yellow, and there are six to nine bracts,
resembling sepals, and six stamens. The minute buds are
purplish and the little flowers are exceedingly pretty and
odd, when we examine them closely, for the sepals turn
back so abruptly from the tiny petals, and from the projecting
cluster of stamens, that the name Inside-out Flower
is appropriate. The fruit is a kind of capsule with many
seeds. This grows in shady woods, especially among
redwoods, up to seven thousand feet. <i>V. hexándra</i> has
thinner leaflets, not evergreen, and the leaflets of <i>V. chrysántha</i>
have white margins.

<p>There are many kinds of Barberry, widely distributed;
shrubs, with yellow wood; the leaves often spiny and the
flowers yellow; the sepals six to nine, with bracts and
resembling petals; the petals six, in two overlapping rows,
each with two glands at the base; the stamens six, with
anthers that open by little valves like trap-doors, hinged
at the top, sensitive and, when they are touched, closing
around the shield-shaped stigma; the fruit a berry, with
one or few seeds.</p>

<p>This does not look much like the common
cultivated kinds of Barberry, for it
grows close to the ground in a straggling
bunch. In favorable situations it is a
handsome and conspicuous plant. The
leaves, with from three to seven leaflets,
are stiff, prickly, and evergreen like Holly,
and the yellow flowers are in clusters at the ends of the
stems, with opposite bracts. The six sepals, petals, and
stamens are all opposite, that is, with a petal in front of
each sepal and a stamen in front of each petal. In Arizona
the flowers are rather small and the clusters short, but
in Utah they are far handsomer, rich golden-yellow and
sweet-scented, forming clusters two inches long. The
fruit is a handsome blue berry with a "bloom," the color
of wild grapes, contrasting well with the foliage when it
turns red in the autumn, and delicious jelly is made from
them. <i>B. aquifòlium</i>, of Oregon and Washington, is similar,
with much more beautiful, very shining leaves. <i>B.
Féndleri</i>, of the Southwest, is from three to six feet high,
the branches smooth and shiny as if varnished, the leaves
with smooth edges or spiny teeth, and the flowers in numerous
drooping clusters. The calyx has conspicuous,
red bracts and the berry is red.</p>

<p>The only kind, an attractive perennial,
popular on account of its sweet-smelling
foliage, which, however, is not fragrant
until the leaves are dried. It has a very
slender rootstock and only one large leaf,
with a very long, slender leaf-stalk and
three, oddly-shaped leaflets, from two to six inches across,
bright-green, smooth and thin in texture, but not glossy.
The single, very slender flower-stalk, from one to two feet
tall, bears a crowded spike of many, tiny, scentless, white
flowers, without either calyx or corolla, but consisting of
a cluster of stamens, with long, threadlike filaments, the
outer ones broader, and a pistil with a broad stigma and
no style. The effect of the cluster is feathery and pretty
and the broad leaf is very conspicuous, on account of its
size and shape. The crescent-shaped fruit contains one
seed, is at first fleshy, but becomes dry and leathery. This
grows in the woods in the Coast Ranges, from near sea-level
up to seven thousand feet. It is also called Vanilla
Leaf and Deer-foot.</p>

<h3 id="WATER_LILY_FAMILY">WATER LILY FAMILY. <i>Nymphaeaceae</i>.</h3>

<p>A small family, widely distributed in fresh-water lakes

rootstocks, or with tubers, large, floating, or erect
leaves, and large, solitary flowers, with long flower-stalks;
sepals three to twelve; petals three to many; stamens six

stamens have dark-red anthers, but yellow pollen, and
both petals and stamens are densely crowded around the
ovary. The round fruit has a narrow neck, concave top,
and many seeds. In quiet mountain ponds we find these
yellow flowers, on stout stems standing up out of the water,
the lily-pads floating idly on its surface. Indians grind
the seeds into meal for porridge, or else roast them and
eat them like popcorn.</p>

<h3 id="STRAWBERRY_SHRUB_FAMILY">STRAWBERRY SHRUB FAMILY. <i>Calycanthaceae</i>.</h3>

<p>A very small family, of only two genera, one North
American, one Japanese; aromatic shrubs, with opposite,
toothless leaves, with short leaf-stalks, without stipules;
flowers large, solitary, at the ends of leafy branches; sepals,
petals, and stamens, indefinite in number, in many, overlapping
series, passing one into the other, so that one
cannot tell which is which, and all borne on the receptacle,
which is hollow, resembling a rose-hip, almost enclosing
the numerous pistils; stamens short, the inner ones without
anthers; receptacle becoming a large, leathery, oblong or
pear-shaped fruit, containing few or many, smooth, shining
akenes.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of Calycanthus in this country,

<p>This resembles the familiar shrub of
old-fashioned gardens and the flowers
have the same pleasant and elusive aroma,
something like strawberries, much more
spicy when crushed. The shrub is four
to ten feet high, with rather coarse, harsh
foliage and large, handsome flowers, two or three inches
across, warm maroon in color, shading to brown and
purple, with yellow stamens. This is handsome and
conspicuous, because of the uncommon and rich coloring
of its flowers, and grows along watercourses in the canyons
of the foothills and is most common in northern California.
It has many other names, such as Sweet Shrub, Carolina
Allspice, Wineflowers, etc.

<h3 id="POPPY_FAMILY">POPPY FAMILY. <i>Papaveraceae</i>.</h3>

<p>A rather large family, widely distributed, most abundant
in the north temperate zone; herbs, rarely shrubs,
with milky, mostly yellow juice and narcotic or acrid
properties; the leaves mostly alternate, without stipules;
the parts of the flower usually all separate and distinct,
borne on a top-shaped receptacle. There are usually two
sepals, which fall off when the blossom opens, and usually
four petals, overlapping and crumpled in the bud; the
stamens are usually numerous and conspicuous, with
thread-like filaments; the superior ovary becomes a many-seeded
capsule.</p>

<p>There are only two kinds of Romneya, much alike,
smooth, stout, perennial herbs, several feet high, with
colorless sap, the leaves alternate and more or less divided;
three sepals, each with a broad wing on the back; six, large,
white petals; many stamens; the ovary covered with
bristles. These plants are nowhere common, but are
found from Santa Barbara south, and in lower California
sometimes grow in great profusion. They are extensively
cultivated and much admired abroad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Matilija Poppy,

<i>Romnèya

<p>This is often considered the handsomest
flower in the West and it would be hard
to find anything more beautiful and
striking than its magnificent blossoms.
The plant has somewhat the effect of a
Peony-bush, sometimes, in cultivation, as
much as five feet high, with many smooth
stems and handsome, smooth, light-green foliage, the
leaves cut and lobed, those near the top with a few prickles.
The splendid flowers are enormous, from five to nine
inches across, with diaphanous, white petals, crinkled like
crêpe tissue-paper, and bright golden centers, composed of
hundreds of yellow stamens surrounding a greenish-white
pistil. The blossoms remain open for several days. The
hard, round buds are covered with short, brown hairs.
This is the true Matilija Poppy, (pronounced Matíliha,)
as it is the kind that grows in the canyon of that name,
but the tremendous floods of 1914 drowned most of these
beautiful plants in that locality. <i>R</i>. <i>Còulteri</i> is similar,
but the buds are smooth and the stems more robust.

<p>There are several kinds of Argemone, natives of the
warmer parts of America, with bitter, yellow juice, spiny-toothed
leaves and large, conspicuous flowers, the buds

<p>The prickly, bluish-green foliage of this
decorative and handsome plant is thistle-like
both in form and color. The leafy,
branching stems, two or three feet high,
are covered with dense, white or yellowish
prickles and bear several lovely flowers,
over three inches across, with delicately crumpled, white
petals and beautiful golden centers, composed of numerous
yellow stamens, both stem and leaves having a bluish
"bloom." The three prickly green sepals each have a
spine-like beak and form a queer-looking, three-horned
bud; the pistil has a purplish, cap-shaped stigma, with six
lobes, and the prickly ovary becomes a very prickly capsule.
This grows in dry places and looks very beautiful
and striking when we find its fragile flowers waving in the
wind against a background of hot desert sand. It varies
a good deal in prickliness and in the form both of plant and
flower. When there is only one large flower in bloom,
surrounded by a circle of prickly buds, it suggests a fairy
princess, guarded by a retinue of fierce warriors. The
flowers are often quite broad and flat, and then are sometimes
given the prosaic name of Fried-eggs.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Papaver; with milky juice,
leaves lobed or cut, nodding flower buds, showy regular
flowers, with two or three sepals and four to six petals.
The stigmas are united to form a disk with rays and the
fruit is a round or oblong capsule, opening near the top.
Both the Latin and common name, Poppy, are ancient.

two or three inches across, usually bright-yellow, shading

They open in sunlight and when blooming in quantities
are a beautiful sight, covering the hillsides with a cloth of
gold. In southern Arizona a similar kind often borders
the dry beds of streams with bright color, with much the
same value in the landscape as the Marsh Marigolds along
New England streams. It is the State flower of California
and has many poetic Spanish names, such as Torosa,

<p>This is not a true Poppy, but the flowers
are sufficiently like to be quite surprising
when we find them growing on what
appears to be a small willow tree! It is a
handsome and decorative shrub, both in
form and color, two to eight feet high,
with pale woody stems, the main stem with shreddy bark,
and light bluish-green foliage, the leaves something like
those of willow, but quite stiff and leathery, with a little
pointed tip, the short leaf-stalks twisted so as to bring the
leaf into a vertical position. Sprinkled all over the bush
are numbers of beautiful, clear golden-yellow flowers,
one to three inches across, with orange-colored anthers
and a pale-yellow pistil. This grows on dry, sunny hillsides,
at middle altitudes, and is common in southern
California, but is particularly fine near Santa Barbara.
The flowers have a slight smell like cucumber and may be
found in bloom at all seasons of the year. The ribbed
seed-pod is long and narrow.</p>

<p>There is only one kind of Platystemon, with stem leaves

and irregular, perfect flowers, of peculiar shape, with two,
scale-like sepals, and four petals, the inner pair narrower
than the outer and united by their tips over the stamens
and style. The six stamens are in two, equal sets, the
filaments of each set somewhat united, the middle anther
of each set with two cells, the others with only one. The
superior ovary develops into a long, dry, one-celled capsule,
containing shiny, black seeds. This family has been
united to the Poppies by Bentham and Hooker, because
the plan of the flowers is similar, though their appearance
is unlike.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Bicuculla, natives of North
America and Asia; perennials, with beautiful foliage and
decorative flowers, of the curious and intricate shape we
are familiar with in old-fashioned gardens. The pedicels
have two bracts; the corolla is heart-shaped at base; the
outer pair of petals are oblong and concave, with spreading
tips and spurred or pouched at base, the inner pair are
narrow and clawed, with crests or wings on the back; the
style is slender, with a two-lobed stigma, each lobe with
two crests. The creeping rootstock is surrounded by a
bulb-like cluster of fleshy grains. These plants are often
called Dutchman's Breeches, from the shape of the flower,
which, of course, also gives the pretty name Bleeding Heart.
Bicuculla is from the Latin, meaning "double-hooded."</p>

<p>The general appearance of this handsome
plant is striking and Japanese in
effect, and the coloring of the feathery,
pale-green foliage and the golden-yellow
flowers is exceedingly odd and beautiful.
The large, finely-cut leaves are sometimes
a foot long, and resemble delicate ferns,
and the smooth, stout, rather coarse flower-stems bear a
few pretty flowers, which are a soft shade of yellow, about
three-quarters of an inch long, the usual Bleeding Heart
shape, but not drooping, and with a strong narcotic odor,
much like that of poppies. This is sometimes as much as
four feet high and grows in sunny places on dry ridges in
the Coast Ranges, but is nowhere common.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Capnoides, natives of the
north temperate zone and Africa. They have oddly-shaped
flowers, something like Bleeding Heart, but with
only one spur, at the back on the upper side, instead of two.
The name is from the Greek, meaning "smokelike," in
allusion to the odor of some kinds.</p>

with very pretty, delicate, pale-green
foliage and bright-yellow flowers, each
about half an inch long, on slender pedicels,
in a loose cluster. The spurs give
them a quaint and pert effect. The style stays on the tip
of the long curved capsule, which looks like a bean-pod,
drooping or sticking out at an awkward angle from the
stem. This is especially fine in some of the mountain
valleys in Utah, making beautiful clumps of foliage; it is
widely distributed and is also found in the East. In the
West it is sometimes called Dutchman's Breeches and
confused with that plant, but rather absurdly so, for the
Dutchman could have only one leg!</p>

<h3 id="MUSTARD_FAMILY">MUSTARD FAMILY. <i>Cruciferae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, widely distributed. Both the English
and Latin names are appropriate, for the watery juice of
these plants is pungent, like mustard, and the flowers
spread out their four petals in the form of a cross. They
are herbs, the leaves alternate or from the root, usually
with no leaf-stalks. The flowers have four petals, with
claws; four sepals, the two outer ones narrow, apt to drop
off; six stamens, two of them short. The ovary is superior,
usually with a single style and stigma, and usually develops
into a pod, divided in two by a transparent partition,
which remains after the pod has opened from below;
in some kinds the pod remains closed. The flowers
generally grow in clusters and though they are often small
they produce honey and so are frequented by bees and
flies. The family is easily recognized by the four petals
and in most species by two stamens being shorter than the
others, but the flowers are so much alike that the various
kinds have to be determined by examining the fruit.
Radish and Horse-radish, Mustard and Water-cress all
belong to this family, as well as many familiar garden
flowers, such as Sweet Alyssum, Candytuft, Rockets, and
Stocks, and many are common weeds, such as Peppergrass
and Shepherd's Purse.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Dentaria, smooth perennials,
with rather large white or pink flowers and tuberous rootstocks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Milk Maids,

<p>A charming plant, with a purplish stem,
from six inches to two feet tall, and pretty
leaves, varying in shape, those from the
root being roundish in outline, or with
three leaflets, but the stem-leaves with
three or five leaflets. The flowers are
about three-quarters of an inch across,
with pure-white or pale-pink petals. This is one of the
loveliest of the early spring flowers in the Coast Ranges
and usually found in damp spots, both in woods and open
places, often whitening the meadows with its blossoms.

<p>There are a good many kinds of Thelypodium, natives
of North America, all western or southwestern; mostly
smooth plants, the leaves usually with leaf-stalks, the
flowers in clusters; stamens long, conspicuous, with very
narrow, arrow-shaped anthers; pods long, cylindrical or
four-sided, often twisted, sometimes on a slender stalk;
seeds oblong, flattish, in one row in each cell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Thelypòdium

<p>This has small flowers, but often grows
in such quantities on the flats near Salt
Lake that it tints the fields with purple.
The purplish stem is from twelve to fifteen
inches tall and the leaves are light bluish-green
and very smooth, the root-leaves with long leaf-stalks,
and the stem-leaves arrow-shaped and clasping at
base. The flowers are about half an inch across, with a
purplish-tinged calyx and pale pinkish-lilac petals, and form
flat-topped clusters. The pods are spreading and rather
knobby. This usually grows on dry hills, reaching an altitude
of over nine thousand feet, as far east as Wyoming.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Arabis, widely distributed,
with small, white or purplish flowers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Fendler's Arabis</b><br />

<p>This is a rather pretty plant, a foot or
more tall, with more or less hairy stems
and leaves and pretty clusters of magenta
flowers, each about a quarter of an inch
across. It grows on the rim of the Grand
Canyon.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Erysimum, most abundant in
Europe and Asia. They are usually biennial or perennial,
more or less downy; mostly with yellow flowers; the pods
long, narrow and squarish or flattish, rarely round, with
numerous seeds, in one row. In Europe these plants often
grow in the crannies of old walls, hence the common name.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Western Wallflower</b><br />
<i>Erýsimum

<p>The vivid glowing orange of these
handsome flowers is exceedingly effective
among the dark tree-trunks of the mountain
forests where they often grow. They
are widely distributed as far east as Ohio.
The stout, purplish stems are from one to
two feet tall and the long, narrow leaves,
often toothed, are apt to be purplish on
the under side, and both stem and leaves are rather rough.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
The fragrant flowers, each about three-quarters of an inch
across, form a handsome cluster, about three inches across.
The calyx is yellow, the pistil green, and the anthers brown.
The conspicuous, four-sided pods are spreading or erect,
from one to five inches long, with a stout beak. In the
high mountains the orange-color gives way to the variety
<i>perénne</i>, with lemon-colored flowers, perhaps commoner
than the orange, not so tall, and wonderfully handsome in
the Wasatch Mountains, around Mt. Rainier and similar
places, and widely distributed. The Cream-colored Wallflower,
<i>E. capitàtum</i>, blooms early, growing near the coast;
the flowers large, handsome, but not sweet-scented.</p>

thin, greenish sepals. This grows on moist, mountain
slopes. <i>T. alpéstre</i>, of the Northwest, is similar, but without

small white flowers and funny little seed-pods,

<p>There are many kinds of Streptanthus, difficult to distinguish,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
smooth plants, often with a "bloom"; stems
branching; leaves often clasping at base, the lower ones
usually more toothed or lobed than the upper. The
flowers are very peculiar in shape, not like most Mustards,
but suggesting the shape of a Bleeding Heart flower; the
sepals usually colored like the petals, two or all of them
bulging at base, so that the calyx is broad below and contracted
above; the corolla regular or irregular, the petals
purple or white, with claws and narrow, wavy or crisp
borders; the stamens four long and two short, or in three
unequal pairs, the longest pair often united below; the
pods long, narrow, flattish or cylindrical, on a broad
receptacle; the seeds flat and more or less winged. These
plants are called Jewel-flower, but the name does not seem
particularly appropriate.</p>

<p>Nothing about this odd-looking plant is
pretty and it almost seems as if it were
trying to make up by eccentricity for its
lack of beauty. It is common in dry,
sandy places in the mountains and our
attention is first attracted to the tall,
branching stalks, because they are strung
with such queer-looking leaves. In summer the upper ones
are bright-yellow or dull-purple and they clasp the stem
and curve over, so that they look like small brass shields,
pierced by the stem. There are three or four of these
curving leaves, very smooth and shiny, and several more
below, which are flatter and dark-green, and the stem, from
six inches to three feet high, is oddly twisted and leans to
one side. The small flowers are yellowish or mauve, veined
with purple, less than half an inch long and peculiar in
shape. The contrast in color between the flowers and
leaves is very odd and very ugly, but as if this were not
enough, later in the season the curious thing hangs itself
with ridiculously long, slender pods, like great hooks, and
looks queerer and more disheveled than ever.</p>

<p>The pretty common name of this tall,
handsome plant was given by Helen Hunt
Jackson and the long, feathery wand of
numerous blossoms is beautiful and suggests
a plume. On the other hand, the
straggling flowers have such long, narrow,
curling petals, the threadlike filaments
look so much like curling antennae and the
long, thin pods stick out so awkwardly, like insects' legs,
from among the flowers on the lower part of the stalk, that
we find the general effect is rather weird and spidery. In
fact the plant I drew had a large yellow spider, precisely
the color of the flowers, half-concealed among them. The
stem is from two to five feet high; the leaves are smooth,
pale bluish-green, the lower ones with leaflets and a leaf-stalk,
and the flowers are bright-yellow, or cream-color,
about an inch across. This grows usually in dampish

sandy wastes of the Petrified Forest,
where it seems a miracle that anything

with racemes of small bright-yellow flowers.
The small, thickish leaves are long, narrow
and white with close down, the stems, about three inches
high, branch at the root and the little pods are tipped with
a style of about their own length. <i>L. Gordóni</i>, of Arizona,
also has clusters of little yellow flowers, often covering
sandy hillsides with bright color; the leaves slightly stiff

<p>The flowers of this family are much like the Mustards,
but the stamens are all of equal length and are often more
than six; the leaves are alternate and consist of three or
several leaflets, with stalks, and the plant usually tastes
bitter and disagreeable instead of pungent. There is no
partition in the pods, which are on long, threadlike stalks;
the ovary is superior and the seeds are kidney-shaped.
Many flowers have only a rudimentary pistil and never
produce fruit. The Caper, of which we eat the pickled
flower-buds for a relish, is a shrub which grows in the
Levant. The family is quite large and flourishes in warm

base of the leaf-stalk, in place of a stipule. The flowers
are about half an inch across, and are a beautiful warm
shade of golden-yellow, the long stamens being of the same
color and giving a very pretty feathery appearance to the

<p>In Arizona this exceedingly handsome
plant often covers the dry beds of rivers
with acres of beautiful color. The
smooth, branching stem is sometimes as
much as eight feet high. The upper
leaves are long and narrow and the lower
are larger and usually have three leaflets, but all are bluish-green
and peculiarly soft and smooth to the touch. The
buds are purple and the delicate flowers, with threadlike
flower-stalks, grow in a handsome, feathery cluster, sometimes
a foot long, with numerous bracts. They have four,
pinkish-lilac or white petals and six exceedingly long,
threadlike stamens with minute, curling, green anthers.
The lilac pistil is also very long and before the flower drops
off begins to develop into a small, flat, green pod. These
gradually lengthen, until the stem is ornamented with
many hooklike pods, with slender stalks, hanging all along
it. Many of the flowers do not produce fruit. The
foliage when it is crushed gives off a rank, unpleasant smell,
which is responsible for the local name of Skunk-weed.
This is widely distributed and is found in the central and
northern part of the United States, as well as in the Southwest.</p>

<p>An odd-looking plant, with very pretty,
feathery flower-clusters. The hairy stem
is over a foot tall and the leaves are bright
yellowish-green and mostly smooth on the
upper side, with hairy margins and hairy
on the under side. The flowers are a warm shade of
bright golden-yellow and form a handsome, rather flat-topped
cluster, with long stamens, and the oblong pods are
an inch long or less, flat and much broader than those of
the last. The flowers are slightly sweet-scented and the
whole plant exudes a faint unpleasant odor. This is
conspicuous on the dreary mesas around Reno, often
growing with <i>Cleomella longipes</i>, which it very much
resembles in general appearance, except for the pods,
which are quite different.</p>

<p>There is only one kind of Isomeris.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Bladderpod</b><br />
<i>Isómeris arbòrea</i><br />
<b>Yellow<br />
Spring<br />
California</b></div>

<p>This is a shrub about three feet high,
which is attractive except for its unpleasant
smell. The leaves are smooth,
toothless, stiffish and thickish, and bluish-green,
with a small bristle at the tip, and
mostly with three leaflets. The pretty flowers are nearly
an inch across and warm yellow in color, not very bright
but pretty in tone, with six very long, yellow stamens, and
form a short, oblong cluster. The ovary has such a long
stalk, even in the flower, that it gives an odd appearance
and it develops into a very curious and conspicuous,
drooping pod, an inch and a half long, much inflated and
resembling a very fat pea-pod, on a long stalk, with two
rows of seeds like little peas inside it, which taste very
bitter. This is quite common on southern mesas. The
name Bladderpod is also used for Lesquerella, which belongs
to the Mustard Family.</p>

<h3 id="ORPINE_FAMILY">ORPINE FAMILY. <i>Crassulaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A rather large family, widely distributed; odd-looking,
mostly very succulent herbs, with smooth, fleshy leaves
and stems, without stipules; flowers in clusters; sepals,
petals, pistils, and stamens, all of the same number, usually
four or five, sometimes the stamens twice as many; ovary
superior; receptacle with honey-bearing scales, one behind
each pistil; pistils separate, developing into small dry pods,
containing few or many, minute seeds. Some of these
plants look like tiny cabbages and we are all familiar with
their tight little rosettes in the formal garden-beds of hotels
and railway stations, where they are so stiff and unattractive
that we hardly recognize them when we find
them looking exceedingly pretty in their natural homes.
The Latin name means "thick."</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Sedum, no one kind very
widely distributed; fleshy herbs; leaves usually alternate;
flowers star-like, often in one-sided clusters; stamens and
pistils sometimes in different flowers on different plants;
sepals and petals four or five; stamens eight or ten, on the
calyx, the alternate ones usually attached to the petals;
styles usually short. The Latin name means "to sit,"
because these plants squat on the ground, and Stonecrop
is from their fondness for rocks.</p>

<p>This makes beautiful golden patches,
on dry slopes or more or less open hilltops,
usually among limestone rocks. The
reddish stems are from six to ten inches
tall, the leaves are rather long and narrow,
thick but flat, forming pretty pale-green
rosettes, more or less tinged with pink and yellow, and the
pretty starry flowers are three-quarters of an inch across,
bright-yellow, with greenish centers, the stamens giving a
feathery appearance.</p>

<p>On moss-covered rocks, moistened by
the glistening spray blowing from the
Yosemite waterfalls, we find these beautiful

a brilliant, many-colored carpet. The
flowers are stars of brightest gold, about
half an inch across and delicately scented,
and form flat-topped clusters, three or four inches across.

The upper part of the stalk, which is about six inches tall,
and the upper leaves are delicate bluish-green, but both
stem and leaves shade to vivid scarlet at the base. Spreading
out on the ground from the base of the stem in all
directions are numerous little runners, each bearing at the
end a small rosette of thick, blue-green leaves, forming a
beautiful contrast to the vivid color of flowers and stems.
The leaves and runners are very brittle and break off at a
touch.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Dudleya; perennials, very

stem-leaves mostly bract-like, usually with a broad,
clasping base; flowers mostly yellow or reddish; calyx
conspicuous, with five lobes; petals united at base; stamens
ten. Most of these plants grow in the South, often on
rocks, in such shallow soil, that they would die in dry
weather, except that the juicy leaves retain their moisture
for a long time and nourish the plant. They resemble
Sedum in appearance, but as the petals are more or less
united the flowers are not starlike. The Indians make
poultices out of the leaves.</p>

<p>The succulent, reddish flower-stalks of
this handsome plant bear large, loose,
rather flat-topped clusters of orange-red
flowers, on coiling branches, and are about
a foot tall, with scaly bracts, springing
from a large handsome rosette on the
ground of very thick, pale-green leaves,
often tinged with pink. Other smaller
rosettes form a circle around it, hence its nice little common
name. <i>D. pulverulénta (Echeveria)</i> is beautiful but weird-looking.
It has red flowers, and the rosette, resembling
a small Century-plant, is covered all over with a white
powder which, among ordinary herbage, gives an exceedingly
striking and ghostlike effect. This plant is sometimes
a foot and a half across, with as many as eight, tall
stalks, and is found from San Diego to Santa Barbara.

<h3 id="SAXIFRAGE_FAMILY">SAXIFRAGE FAMILY. <i>Saxifragaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, almost all herbs, living usually in temperate
regions. They have no very peculiar characteristics
and resemble the Rose Family, but sometimes their leaves
are opposite, usually they have no stipules and have fewer
stamens than Roses, not more than twice as many as the
sepals, and usually the pistils, from two to five in number,
with distinct styles, are united to form a compound ovary,
which is superior or partly inferior; sepals usually five;
petals four, five, or rarely none, alternate with the sepals;
petals and stamens borne on the calyx; fruit a dry pod or
berry, containing numerous seeds. The Latin name means
"rock breaker," as many grow among rocks.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Parnassia, of north temperate
and arctic regions; smooth perennials; leaves toothless,
almost all from the root; flowers single; sepals five; petals
five, each with a cluster of sterile filaments, tipped with
glands, at the base; fertile stamens five, alternate with the
petals; ovary superior, or partly inferior, with a very short
style, or none, usually with four stigmas; fruit a capsule,
containing numerous winged seeds. These plants were
called Grass of Parnassus by Dioscorides, but are not grasslike.
They resemble the other members of this family so
little that they have been made into a separate family by
some botanists.</p>

delicately veined with green and prettily
fringed towards the base, and pale yellow

stiff cluster of sterile filaments, like a tiny green hand.
This grows on banks of streams and in moist places,
reaching an altitude of eleven thousand feet. <i>P. Californica</i>
is similar, but the petals not fringed.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Leptasea, perennials, with

petals of the same color, but so narrow that they look like
long curling filaments. The three stamens are opposite the
three upper sepals, the ovary is superior and the capsule
has two long beaks. Young plants often spring from the

branching very abruptly. The small
leaves are smooth and very bright green
on the upper side, but the under side is
very pale and covered with close white
down. The flowers are much smaller than the garden
Syringa, with white petals and numerous yellow stamens,
the calyx reddish outside and downy within, and have a
delicious smell, like lemon-blossoms. This pretty little
shrub may be found growing in small shady canyons, in
northern Arizona and elsewhere in the Southwest.</p>

<h3 id="GOOSEBERRY_FAMILY">GOOSEBERRY FAMILY. <i>Grossulariaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A small family, shrubs, with alternate, palmately-lobed
leaves, often sticky or resinous; the flowers almost always
in clusters; the pedicels with a bract at the base and
usually with two bractlets halfway up; petals five, or
rarely four, usually smaller than the calyx-lobes; stamens
of the same number as the petals and alternate with them;
ovary inferior, with two styles, more or less united; fruit
a berry, crowned with the withered remains of the flower.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Grossularia, or Gooseberry;
shrubs, sometimes with trailing branches, almost always
spiny; flowers with bracts; ovary often spiny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Wild Gooseberry</b><br />
<i>Grossulària

<p>This is a stout shrub, one to four feet
high, with thick, short, rigid little branches,
the knobby joints more or less spiny.
The roundish leaves, less than an inch
across, are lobed and scalloped, rather
dull green and slightly downy, and the
flowers are about half an inch long, with maroon-colored
sepals and white petals, the base of the calyx-tube downy.
The purple berry is half an inch in diameter and covered
with stout prickles. This Gooseberry is common at
moderate altitudes. The drooping, red and white flowers
resemble tiny Fuchsias, both in color and form. <i>G.
Menzièsii</i>, the Canyon Gooseberry, also has pretty fuchsia-like
flowers and grows in the Coast Ranges of California
and Oregon, blooming in the winter.</p>

Fuchsias as the two last. The stems are
armed with long thorns and the leaves
are thick, dark green, and glossy. The
flowers have four sepals, four petals, and
four stamens and are about an inch long

<p>Wild Roses are widely distributed in the northern

There are numerous kinds; some are climbing, all are
prickly and thorny, with handsome, often fragrant,
flowers and compound leaves, with toothed edges. The
numerous yellow stamens are on the thick margin of a
silky disk, which nearly closes the mouth of the calyx.
The numerous pistils develop into akenes, or small, dry,
one-seeded fruits. These look like seeds and we find them
inside the calyx-tube, which in ripening enlarges and
becomes round or urn-shaped. These swollen calyx-tubes
are the "hips," which turn scarlet and add so much
to the beauty of the rose-bush when the flowers are gone.
Rosa is the ancient Latin name.</p>

<p>This is the only kind. In open places,
in the Sierra forests, the ground is often
carpeted for acres with the feathery
foliage of this charming shrub, sprinkled
all over with pretty white flowers. Mountain
Misery does not at first seem an
appropriate name for so attractive a plant, but when we
walk through the low, green thickets we find not only that
the tangled branches catch our feet but that the whole
plant is covered with a strong-smelling, resinous substance,
which comes off on our clothes in a most disagreeable
manner. On a warm day the forest is filled with the peculiar,
medicinal fragrance and when, later in the season, we
unpack our camping outfit we are apt to be puzzled by the
smell of "Pond's Extract" which our clothes exhale.
The shrub is usually less than two feet high, with downy,
evergreen foliage, the numerous small leaflets so minutely
subdivided and scalloped that they have the appearance
of soft ferns. The flowers resemble large strawberry-blossoms,
and have a top-shaped, five-lobed calyx, many
yellow stamens and one pistil, becoming a large, leathery
akene. The smell and foliage attract attention and the
shrub has many names, such as Bear-mat and Kittikit,
or Kit-kit-dizze, so-called by the Indians. Bears do not
eat it, so the name Bear-clover is poor, and Tarweed
belongs to another plant. It is used medicinally.

These little leaflets, hardly more than

gives the whole "tail" a silky, silvery-gray appearance.
From the midst of a bunch of these curious leaves, which
are mostly from the root, spring several very slender stems,
widely branching above, from six to twelve inches tall,
and at the ends of the branches are airy clusters of pretty

<p>A rather attractive plant, for the foliage
is pretty, though the flowers are not very
conspicuous. The rather stout, roughish
stem, often purplish, is from one to two
feet tall and the leaves are rather dark green, slightly
sticky and sometimes downy. The flowers are about half
an inch across, with white petals, tinged with pink, and
are well set off by the dark reddish or purplish calyxes and
buds, but the petals are too far apart, and there are not
enough flowers out at one time, for the effect to be good.
This varies a good deal in hairiness and there are several
varieties. It is common in Yosemite.

<p>Altitude and soil make a great difference
in the beauty of this shrub. On the
rocky rim of the Grand Canyon it is from
four to eight feet high, picturesquely
gnarled and twisted, but stunted looking,
the gray bark hanging off the crooked
branches and thick, distorted trunk in untidy shreds, the
flowers pale, scanty, and but faintly scented. Halfway
down Bright Angel trail it is a glorious thing, full of color
and fragrance, about twelve feet high, luxuriant and
healthy-looking. The small, leathery, evergreen leaves,
crowded in bunches along the branches, are glossy and rich
in color, setting off the light yellow flowers, with golden
centers, which form long wands of bloom. The upper
branches are clustered closely their whole length with
blossoms, and when the wind sways the flowering branches
to and fro they exhale an exquisite fragrance like orange
flowers. The bloom is at its best in the Canyon in May,
but there are still some lingering flowers in August. The
calyx is top-shaped, with the petals and the two rows of
numerous stamens on the throat of the tube. The pistils,
from five to twelve, are densely woolly. The akenes have
pale, silky-hairy tails, two inches or more in length, suggesting
gone-to-seed Clematis. For some occult reason
this shrub is called Quinine Bush at the Grand Canyon.</p>

flowers, something like Spiraea. They
have a feathery, creamy appearance, owing
to the pale yellow stamens, and the olive-green
foliage sets them off to perfection, the effect of the whole
being very graceful, as the slender, flower-tipped branches
sway to and fro in the wind. This is the most abundant
and characteristic shrub of the higher Coast Ranges and
Sierra Nevada Mountains and sometimes covers miles of
mountain slopes, looking a good deal like heather when it
is not in bloom. When the chaparral is composed entirely
of this shrub it is called chamisal. <i>A. sparsifòlium</i> of
southern California, has scattered leaves and larger flowers.
It is very fragrant and used medicinally by Spanish Californians
and Indians, who call it Yerba del Pasmo, or
"convulsion herb."</p>

has a "bloom," and falls off the receptacle when ripe, but
the Blackberry has shining, black fruit, which clings to

<p>A very handsome, thrifty-looking plant,
about two feet high, the smooth, bright
green foliage contrasting finely with the
clusters of clear yellow flowers, each about
three-quarters of an inch long. The erect,
straight pods, two or three inches long,
are silky and also the calyxes and buds.
This thrives in the mountains, up to an
altitude of nine thousand feet, in somewhat moist spots,
and its fresh coloring is most attractive. The foliage seems
to me to be especially handsome in northern Arizona, but
these plants are also beautiful in the Utah canyons. The
flowers are scentless and last a long time in water. <i>T.
Califórnica</i> has silvery, silky foliage and is common in
California, in damp ground in the hills.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Parosela, of western North
America, Mexico, and the Andes, no one sort common;
generally shrubs; leaves almost always compound; leaflets
odd in number, small, toothless, with minute stipules,
often with glandular dots; flowers small, in terminal clusters;
calyx with nearly equal, long, occasionally feathery
teeth; corolla with wings and keel longer than the standard,
their claws adhering to the lower part of the stamen-tube,
but the claw of the small, heart-shaped standard free;
stamens nine or ten, filaments united, anthers alike; ovary
with a short stalk, or none, style awl-shaped; pod small,
membranous, included in the calyx, usually with one seed.
<i>P. spinòsa</i>, the Smoke Tree, or Ghost Tree, of western
Arizona, is almost leafless, with grayish or whitish branches.

<p>This little spiny desert shrub grows two
or three feet high and is conspicuous on account
of the odd contrast in color between
its foliage and flowers. The woody stems
and branches are very pale in color and the
very small leaflets, so narrow and stiff that they look like
evergreen needles, are covered with pale down and have
glandular dots. All over this colorless foliage are sprinkled
small spikes of indigo-blue flowers, so dark in color that the
effect, against a background of desert sand, is of pale gray,
speckled with black. It has a pleasant smell like balsam.</p>

like a small clover-head, the woolly calyxes giving a

<p>This is the only kind, an evergreen
shrub, flourishing on dry hills in the Coast
Ranges, with tough, crooked branches
and stout spines, forming chaparral so
dense that it is impossible to penetrate.
It grows from three to eight feet high, the
gnarled, knotty, black branches terminating
in long spines, which are often clothed with small
leaves nearly to the end, the leaves with one to three,
small leaflets and without stipules. The bush is often
covered with quantities of pretty, bright, deep purplish-pink
flowers, three-quarters of an inch long, forming a
fine mass of color. The calyx has four, short, broad teeth;
the petals are equal, the standard roundish, with the sides
turned back and a paler spot at base, the wings oblong, the
keel straight; the filaments of the ten stamens not united;
the pod is two inches long, flat, straight, sickle-shaped when
young. This very rarely produces fruit. Stevenson was
probably describing this shrub when he wrote, "Even the
low thorny chaparral was thick with pea-like blossoms."

<p>There are so many western kinds of Lupinus that it is
hopeless for the amateur to distinguish them; herbs,
sometimes shrubs; leaves palmately-compound, stipules
adhering to the base of the leaf-stalk, leaflets, more than
three in number, usually closing at mid-day; flowers showy,
in terminal racemes; calyx deeply toothed, two-lipped;
standard broad, the edges rolling back, wings lightly adhering
above, enclosing the incurved, pointed keel, sometimes
beaked; style incurved, stigma bearded; stamens
united by their filaments, alternate anthers shorter; pod
two-valved, leathery, flat, oblong; seeds two to twelve.
Lupines always have palmately-divided leaves, and are
never trailing, twining, or tendril-bearing and thus may be
superficially distinguished from Vetches and Peas, and
from Thermopsis, by the united stamens.</p>

<p>There are numerous kinds of Lathyrus, widely distributed
and difficult to distinguish. In technical character
and habit they very much resemble Vetches, but
sometimes have no tendrils and the flowers are larger, the
leaflets are broader, and the style is flattened and hairy,
not only at the tip, but also along the upper side. The
leaflets are equal in number, the leaf-stalk usually terminating
in a branching tendril; the flowers are in clusters;
the calyx with five teeth, the upper commonly shorter;
the style flattened and usually twisted; the pod flat or
cylindrical, with no partitions between the seeds. Lathyrus
is the old Greek name of the Pea.</p>

standard pinkish-lilac, delicately veined with purple, the
wings pale lilac and the keel cream-color. The flowers,
as they fade, although keeping their form, gradually change
in color to all shades of blue, turquoise, and sea-green,
finally becoming buff, so that the effect of the whole
cluster is iridescent and very lovely. This grows on
mountain slopes, often in oak-thickets, clambering over
the bushes to a height of several feet and clinging to everything
with its tendrils.

small, and the leaves are smooth, slightly
thickish and stiffish, rather dark bluish-green,
with about ten leaflets. The flowers are over two
inches long, from the tip of the standard to the end of the
keel, and form a massive cluster of eight or ten blossoms,
hanging on drooping pedicels and shading in color from
the pale-salmon of the buds to the brilliant rose, carmine,
and wine-color of the open flowers, the older flowers being
very dark and rich. Only a small part of the flower-cluster
is given in the picture. These plants, which are
found around San Diego and farther south, clamber over
the neighboring bushes to a height of several feet and
adorn them with wonderful color, giving an effect of
tropical splendor.</p>

<p>There are innumerable kinds of Astragalus; most
abundant in Asia, usually perennial herbs, sometimes
woody; leaves usually with numerous leaflets, flowers
narrow, in spikes, with long flower-stalks; calyx tube-shaped,

with slender claws, standard erect and somewhat oblong,
wings oblong, keel with blunt tip, about the same length
as the wings; stamens ten, in two sets of nine and one; pods
numerous, more or less two-celled, often inflated, so the
wind can distribute the small seeds, therefore these plants
are often called Rattleweed. Another name is Milk
Vetch and many kinds are called Loco-weed, from the
word "loco," or crazy, because they are poisonous to horses
and cattle. I was told by a cow-boy in Arizona that
"horses eat this because it tastes sweet, but it gives them
water on the brain and they die, unless the skull is split

<p>A handsome branching shrub, about
five feet high, with almost smooth or
quite hairy leaves, with three, toothless
leaflets, and fine clusters of flowers, each
an inch or more long, with a yellow two-lipped
calyx and a golden-yellow corolla,
deeper in color at the base of the standard
and at the tips of the wings; the stamens ten, in one set; the
style curved in. The pod is flat, smooth on the sides, but
hairy along the edges, one or two inches long and curling
when ripe. This is said to have been brought to California
by Cornish miners.</p>

<h3 id="SENNA_FAMILY">SENNA FAMILY. <i>Cassiaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, most of them tropical; trees, shrubs, and
herbs, with flowers more or less irregular in form, but not
like the flowers of the true Pea, though sometimes resembling
them; calyx usually with five sepals; corolla with
five petals, overlapping in the bud, the petal which corresponds
to the standard folded within the two side petals,
instead of covering them, as in the Pea flower; stamens,
ten, or fewer, in number, usually not united; ovar superior;
fruit a pod, mostly splitting into two halves, containing
one to many seeds. To this family belong the handsome
Red-bud, or Judas Tree, of our woodlands, both East and
West; the spiny Honey-locust; the Kentucky Coffee-tree,
with its fine foliage, of the central and eastern states; the
interesting Palo Verde, with greatly reduced leaves, of the
Southwest, and the fine Bird-of-paradise flowers, of
the tropics and Mexico, one or two of which are just beginning
to grow wild in southern Arizona and California.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Cassia, abundant in tropical
America; herbs, shrubs, or trees; leaflets even in number;
flowers usually yellow; calyx-teeth nearly equal; corolla
almost regular, with five, nearly equal, spreading petals,
with claws; stamens usually ten, sometimes five, often
unequal, some of the anthers often imperfect, or lacking;
pod flat or cylindrical, often curved, sometimes with
partitions between the numerous seeds.

<p>The peculiar orange-yellow of these
handsome flowers at once attracts our
attention, for their tint is quite different
from the greenish-yellow, which is so
much more common. They grow in the
desert, forming big clumps, two feet high
and two or three feet across, but have almost no foliage.
The numerous, smooth stems are very pale in color, often
bluish or gray, with a few dark-green leaves, with six,
very small, stiff leaflets, and bearing clusters of numerous,
sweet-smelling flowers, almost regular and about three-quarters
of an inch across, with a downy calyx and the
small, flat pod also downy.</p>

in character, about a foot tall, with
a few, pale-gray, spreading branches and
very scanty foliage. The small leaves are
cut into many tiny leaflets and look like
those of a Mimosa, the buds are deep
pink and the flowers are in clusters towards the ends of
the branches and slightly sweet-scented. They are very
queer-looking, but exceedingly pretty, for the purplish
calyx and corolla are so small that the flower appears to be
merely a tuft of many stamens, about an inch long, with
threadlike filaments, white at base and shading to bright
pink at the tips. The pistil is also long and pink, so the
whole effect is a bunch of pink fuzz, airy in form and delicately
shaded in color. These little shrubs sometimes
bloom when they are only a few inches high, looking very
quaint, like dwarf plants in a toy garden, and are among
the earliest spring flowers.

pretty flowers are nearly an inch across, with bright yellow
petals, with claws, and silky, greenish-yellow sepals which
soon drop off. The filaments are broadened below into
wings and have a scale on the inner side. The ovary is
covered with pale, silky hairs, so that the older flowers
have a silky tuft in the center, and becomes a round,
densely hairy fruit, with a short stalk, tipped with the
slender style. These little white, silky balls of down are
very conspicuous and, as they are mingled with yellow
flowers, the bush has an odd and pretty effect of being
spotted all over with yellow and white.</p>

The stems are often reddish; the
leaves somewhat hairy; the flowers small,
in clusters of four to eight, with four bracts at the base; the
petals purplish-pink, with darker veins, and hairy at the
base, the two upper petals slightly smaller; the sepals tipped
with one or two bristles. The ovary is beaked by the
united styles, the beak, when the seeds ripen, separating
into five, long tails, which twist spirally when dry and
untwist when moistened. This is common west of the
Rockies, blooming more or less all the year round, varying
in size in different soils. Filaree is a corruption of the
Spanish Alfilerilla, from "alfiler," a "pin." Other names
are Pinkets, Pinclover, Storksbill, and Clocks, so-called
by children because they amuse themselves by watching
the tails twist about like the hands of a clock. White-stem

flowers have a rather heavy scent and are
about an inch across, with four or five, slightly irregular,
white petals, which become pink in fading, a pinkish ovary
and long stamens with curling, white filaments, unequal in
length, with buff anthers. They are crowded in a magnificent,
pyramidal cluster, about a foot long, which has a
pinkish-red, downy stem, and the buds are also downy
and pinkish, so that the color effect is warm-pink above,
merging into cream-white below, the whole made feathery
by the long stamens. The shrub has a rounded top of rich
green foliage, symmetrically ornamented with spires of
bloom, standing up quite stiffly all over it. The large,
leathery pod contains a big, golden-brown nut, supposed

rich green, leafy mat, sprinkled with
small, feathery clusters of blue flowers.
The trailing stems are clothed with
leathery leaves, opposite and very glossy,

with yellow stamens, and slightly scented. These
plants are equally attractive late in the season when the
flowers are replaced by scarlet seed-vessels, with three horns.</p>

bark and the bright green foliage
setting off the feathery flower clusters,
two to six inches long, scattered lightly

leaves are alternate, half an inch to three inches long,
toothless, thin in texture, very slightly downy or smooth,
with three veins, and the flowers cream-white, occasionally
blue or pink, with conspicuous stamens, which give the
plume-like sprays a delicate foamy effect against the dark
forest background. This shrub is a beautiful sight when

entirely without branches, stand up stiffly
from the root, like a bunch of wands, and
are armed their whole length with terrible
thorns, which in the spring are masked
with beautiful foliage, like little apple
leaves. From the tip of each wand springs a glorious
cluster, from six to ten inches long, composed of hundreds
of scarlet flowers, each about an inch long, and crowded
closely together, suggesting a flame and waving to and
fro in the wind with a startling effect against the pale
desert sand. When the flowers and leaves are gone, the

They make an impenetrable fence and are much used by

larger and with a spur at the back; stamens five, short,

lower anthers with spurs at the base, which project into the
spur of the petal; ovary superior and one-celled; style club-shaped,
with a one-sided stigma. The flowers are often

petals and showy, but not producing seed; the later ones
with short stalks, with small or no petals, but fertile, often
cleistogamous, that is, fertilized in the bud. The capsule
splits open and as the three valves dry they fold firmly

<h3 id="LOASA_FAMILY">LOASA FAMILY. <i>Loasaceae.</i></h3>

<p>Not a very large family, all but one natives of America;
herbs, armed with hooked, stinging or sticky hairs; without
stipules; the flowers perfect, with five sepals and five
to ten petals; the stamens numerous, with threadlike
filaments, the outer ones sometimes petal-like, inserted
with the petals on the throat of the calyx and usually
arranged in clusters opposite the petals; the ovary inferior,
with a threadlike style; the capsule crowned with the calyx-lobes.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Mentzelia, all western, often
with white shining stems and alternate leaves; the calyx
cylindrical or top-shaped, with five lobes; the petals five
or ten; the styles three, somewhat united. The barbed
hairs which clothe the stems and leaves make the plant
stick to whatever it touches, probably helping to distribute
the seeds, hence the common name Stick-leaf.</p>

quantities of very long stamens, making a beautiful center.
Five of the stamens have broadened filaments, resembling
narrow petals, the style is three-cleft, and the capsule is
oblong, containing many flat, winged seeds. These plants
usually grow in dry stream-beds and are not rare, but
through various accidents I have never been able to secure

<p>A common and useful kind, the shape
and often the size of a barrel, covered with
spines. The Indians cut off the top of the
plant and pound the pulp with a stick
into a soft mass, which they squeeze with
their hands, extracting a large amount of
watery juice, which is wholesome and not
unpalatable and has often saved lives in the desert. Indians
use the spines for fish-hooks, hence a common name, Fishhook
Cactus, and the celebrated cactus candy is made
from it. The flowers are large.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Echinocereus, oblong or cylindrical,
spiny plants, generally a few inches tall, usually
growing in clumps; stems ridged, or with spiny ribs; fruits

<p>There are many kinds of Opuntia, with jointed stems,
cylindrical or flattened, armed with bristles, usually with
spines. The fruits and fleshy joints are good for fodder, if
the spines are removed, and hence there has been much
inquiry into the economic value of these plants. It has
been found that the spiny species are the most valuable
for fodder, under extremely arid conditions, as the spines
can be burned off, while the unarmed forms are subject to
the attacks of so many animals that a crop cannot be
secured without the protection of fences. The spines are
removed either by singeing the growing plant with a torch,
or the upper parts are cut off and thrown into a fire,
or sometimes the plants are made into fodder by being
chopped up, spines and all, in a machine. The Prickly
Pears in Sicily and the Orient came from America.</p>

<p>A horrible shrub, or dwarf tree, four to
six feet high, with a thick trunk and
several, spreading, contorted branches,
with cylindrical joints, twisting in awkward
ways. The trunk and larger limbs
are brownish-gray, starred with dead, dry spines, but the
twigs are pale bluish-green, covered thickly with stars of
pale-yellowish spines, each an inch or so long, with a
barbed tip. From the numerous magenta flowers strange,
yellowish, cup-shaped fruits develop, seeming to spring one
out of the other in a haphazard way, hanging in long chains,
awkward but rather ornamental, and remaining on the
plants for several years without change, except that they
grow slightly larger. The distant effect of this plant is
a pale, fuzzy mass, attractive in color, giving no hint of its
treacherous character&mdash;more like a wild beast than a plant!
The joints suggest a very ferocious chestnut-burr and
break off at a touch, thrusting their spines deeply into the
flesh of the unwary passer-by, so that the Indian story, that
this plant flings its darts at wayfarers from a distance,
might almost as well be true, and the barbs making the
extraction difficult and painful. The ground under the
plants is strewn with fallen joints, which take root and
propagate themselves. Small animals pile these around
their holes for defense, several kinds of birds build in the
thorny branches and are safe from enemies, and the fruits,
being spineless and succulent, are valuable for fodder, so
the Cholla is not entirely malevolent. The name is
pronounced <i>Choya</i>. There are many similar kinds, some
with very handsome rose-like flowers, others with bright
scarlet fruits. They are curious and interesting inhabitants
of the desert.</p>

<p>These tree-like plants are wonderfully

numbers on the mountain slopes around
Tucson and are easily recognized by their
size and very upright form, rearing their thick, cylindrical

forty feet. They are smooth and light green, armed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
rows of spines in stars along the ridges, and ornamented
during May and June with handsome, large, whitish, wax-like
flowers, very perfect in form, opening in the daytime,
blooming most abundantly on the sunny side of the plant
and remaining open but a short time. Woodpeckers
often make holes for nests in the branches, which are used
afterwards by a little native owl, the smallest kind in the
world, and by honey-bees, and these holes often lead to
decay and to the ultimate death of the tree. The fruits,
with crimson flesh and black seeds, are valued by the
Papago Indians for food, and mature in enormous quantities
in midsummer, but birds eat up many of the seeds
and of the millions reaching the ground only a very few
germinate and develop into odd, little round plants, a few
inches high, often eaten by some animal before they become
sufficiently prickly for protection.</p>

<p>A handsome plant, with nearly smooth,
slender, reddish stems, a few inches to two
feet tall, and smooth, pale-green, toothless,
narrow leaves, mostly without leaf-stalks.
The buds are erect and the flowers form a
long, loose cluster, with bright purplish-pink petals, half
an inch to over an inch long, with a large, magenta blotch
near the center, or at the tip, and yellowish at base; the
stamens and pistil all purple; the calyx-lobes not caught
together, but turned primly back. This forms fine patches
of bright color in rather meadowy places in Yosemite and
elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada foothills. <i>G. Dudleyàna</i>
is pretty and slender, with drooping buds and light lilac-pink
flowers, the petals paler at base, with darker dots,
the calyx-lobes caught together and turned to one side, and
also makes beautiful patches of color on sunny slopes
around Yosemite.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Clarkia, resembling Godetia,
but the petals have claws. The stems are brittle; the
leaves mostly alternate, with short, slender leaf-stalks; the
buds nodding; the flowers in terminal clusters, with four
petals, never yellow, and four sepals, turned back; the
stamens eight, those opposite the petals often rudimentary;
the stigma four-lobed; the capsule long, leathery, erect,
more or less four-angled, with many seeds. Named in
honor of Captain Clarke, of the Lewis and Clarke expedition,
the first to cross the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific,
in 1806.</p>

and very variable both in size and smoothness.
It grows from six inches to six feet
high; the stems more or less branching;
the leaves sometimes toothed and often reddish; the buds
and calyxes often woolly. The flowers are very gay; the
sepals being dark red or purple, the petals, with long,
slender claws, bright pink and the anthers scarlet! The
stamens, four long and four short, have a hairy, reddish
scale at the base of each filament, the anthers of the shorter
stamens often white, and the capsule is usually curved,
with no stalk, nearly an inch long, often hairy. When the
foliage is red, as it often is, the various combinations of red

<p>Decorative in form and color and unusual
looking, with smooth, pale bluish-green
foliage, with a "bloom," the leaves
prettily cut and lobed, with pinkish leafstalks,
forming, when young, a large
rosette, close to the ground, but the stem
gradually lengthens until the cluster of
leaves, after the flowers are gone, finds itself on the summit
of a long stem, sheathed at base. The minute, bright
yellow flowers form flat-topped clusters, with flower-stems
two or three inches tall, not hollow, the main cluster about
an inch across, usually without bracts, and composed of
five to ten smaller clusters, with bracts. When the plant
is young the general effect of the flat, pale gray rosette of
fern-like leaves, spotted with the contrasting yellow of the
flowers, is pretty and striking. Sometimes a few of the
flowers are purple. This has a thick root and grows on dry
sunny hills, in gravelly soil.

<h3 id="DOGWOOD_FAMILY">DOGWOOD FAMILY. <i>Cornaceae.</i></h3>

<p>Not a very large family, most abundant in the northern
hemisphere, mostly trees or shrubs. They have simple,
mostly toothless leaves, without stipules, usually opposite
or in whorls. The flowers are in round or flat-topped
clusters and have four or five sepals and petals and four to
many stamens. The inferior ovary becomes a stone-fruit
that looks like a berry. Cornus is from the Greek for
"horn," in allusion to the toughness of the wood.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Cornus, some natives of Mexico
and Peru, with small, white, greenish or purple flowers, in
clusters, which often have an involucre of large, white
bracts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Pacific Dogwood</b><br />

Spring, summer<br />
Oreg., Wash., Cal.</b></div>

<p>A handsome shrub or small tree, from
ten to thirty feet high and growing in rich
woods, often near streams. The flower
clusters are composed of numerous, small,
greenish flowers, forming a large, protruding
knob, which is surrounded by large, white, petal-like
bracts, usually six in number, giving the effect of a
single handsome flower, measuring from three to six inches
across. It resembles the Flowering Dogwood of the East,
but as the flowers have six instead of four "petals," the
tips of which in Yosemite are neither puckered nor stained
with pink, they look different to eastern eyes and the
general appearance, though equally fine, is less picturesque,
probably because the shrub is rather larger and less straggling,
the flowers bigger and more symmetrical, and the
leaves brighter green. The effect of the flat masses of
creamy white bloom among the darker forest trees is
magnificent, and in Washington and Oregon the leaves turn
to brilliant red in the autumn. The fruit is a cluster of
bright red berries. The wood is exceedingly hard and is
used in cabinet-making. There is a tradition that when
Dogwood blooms corn should be planted.

with one or two pairs of small leaves,
springs from creeping, woody shoots and
is crowned by a circle of larger leaves, six,

off a pretty white blossom, with a slender flower-stalk.
This looks like a single flower, measuring about an inch

superior, with one style; the fruit a capsule, berry, or stone-fruit,
usually with many small seeds.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Gaultheria, mostly of the
Andes; ours are evergreen shrubs, with alternate, aromatic
leaves and nodding flowers; the calyx five-cleft; the corolla
more or less urn-shaped, with five teeth; the stamens ten;

<p>An attractive little shrub, usually from
one to three feet high, with handsome
foliage. The leaves are finely toothed,
dark olive-green, leathery and rather
glossy, pale on the under side, and the
waxy flowers hang gracefully on a stiffly
bending flower-stem, which is sticky and hairy and often
bright red, with large, scaly, red bracts at the base of the
pedicels and smaller bracts halfway up. The flowers are
nearly half an inch long, with a yellowish calyx, covered
with reddish hairs, and a white corolla, tipped with pink,
or all pink; the filaments hairy, with orange anthers.
There is often so much bright pinkish-red about the flower-stems
and bracts that the effect, with the waxy flowers
and dark foliage, is very pretty. This plant often grows in
great quantities, thickly covering the floor of the redwood
forests. It is called Salál by the Oregon Indians, who value
the black, aromatic berries as an important article of food.</p>

<p>A magnificent shrub, the handsomest
in the West, from three to fifteen feet
high, with a grayish trunk and fine,
evergreen foliage. The leaves are from
three to ten inches long, rich-green and
leathery, smooth but not shiny, paler on
the under side, spreading out around the
large flower-clusters, so as to set them off to great advantage,
and the flowers are over two inches across, scentless,
with small, pale sepals and pink corollas, almost white
at the base and shading to deep pink at the edges, which
are prettily ruffled. The upper petal is freckled with
golden-brown, or greenish spots and arrow-shaped
markings, the pistil is crimson and the stamens, with pale
pink filaments and pale yellow anthers, curve in, like little
serpents' heads. The coloring of the flower clusters, mixed
with the crimson-tipped buds, is a combination of delicate
and brilliant tints and in such places as the redwood
forests, along the Noyo River in California, where the
shrub develops into a small tree, the huge clusters, glowing
high above us among the dark forest trees, are a wonderful
sight. This is the "State flower" of Washington.</p>

<p>There are a good many kinds of Arctostaphylos, mostly
western; evergreen shrubs, with very crooked branches;
smooth, dark red or brown bark; alternate leaves, and
usually nodding, white or pink flowers, with bracted
pedicels, in terminal clusters, the parts usually in fives;
the corolla urn-shaped; the stamens usually ten, not protruding,
the filaments hairy; the ovary raised on a disk on
the receptacle; the fruit berry-like, several nutlets surrounded
by soft pulp. The leaves, by a twisting of their
stalks, assume a vertical position on the branches, a habit
which enables many plants of dry regions to avoid unnecessary
evaporation. These shrubs are often very
abundant and with Chaparral Pea, Buck Brush, Scrub

Oak, etc., form the extensive brush thickets known as
chaparral, so characteristic of the western mountain
scenery. The Greek name means "bear-berry," as bears
are fond of the berries, and Manzanita is from the Spanish
for "little apple," as the fruits often resemble tiny apples.
They are dry but pleasantly acid and are popular with
Indians, bears, and chipmunks, and jelly can be made from
them. The largest Manzanita tree known is one in Napa
County, California, thirty-five feet high and as large across.</p>

flower-stalk, from two to six inches tall,
springing from a cluster of glossy, bright
green leaves, with toothed edges, and
bearing a single, lovely sweet-scented blossom, about
three-quarters of an inch across, with usually five sepals
and five, spreading, waxy-white petals; the long, straight
style, with a five-lobed stigma, projecting from the ovary,
which forms a green hump in the center of the flower,
surrounded by eight or ten stamens. This little flower
modestly turns its face down to the ground and we have to
pick it to find how very pretty it is. It grows in wet,
northern mountain woods, across the continent.

<p>There are a good many kinds of Pyrola; leaves mostly
from the root; flowers usually nodding, in clusters, with
bracted flower-stalks; sepals and petals five; stamens ten;
capsule roundish, five-lobed, cobwebby on the edges.
These plants are often called Shinleaf, because English
peasants used the leaves for plasters. Pyrola is from the
Latin for "pear," because of the resemblance of the leaves of
some kinds. The aromatic Wintergreen, or Checker-berry,
used for flavoring, is a Gaultheria, of the Heath Family.</p>

pink stamens and a green pistil, with a conspicuous style,
curving down and the tip turning up. The pretty color

celebrated for its peculiar beauty. The
name is misleading, for the splendid
creatures push their way, not through the
snow, but through the dark forest carpet
of pine-needles, soon after the snow has
melted. The fleshy stems are from six inches to over a
foot tall, the leaves reduced to red scales, and the bell-shaped
flowers, with five lobes, are crowded towards the
upper half of the stem and mingled with long, graceful,
curling, red bracts. The plants are shaded with red all
over, from flesh color, to rose, carmine, and blood-red, and
are translucent in texture, so that when a shaft of sunlight
strikes them they glow with wonderful brilliance, almost
as if lighted from within. They sometimes grow as many
as fifteen together, and are found in the Sierras, up to nine
thousand feet. They are pointed out to tourists by Yosemite
stage drivers, but the government forbids their
being picked, for fear of extermination.</p>

<p>The only kind, found only in North
America, a strange plant, harmonious in
color, with a fleshy, brownish or reddish
stem, from one to four feet tall, with
yellowish bracts and covered with sticky
hairs, springing from a mass of matted,
fibrous, astringent roots. The flowers are
a quarter of an inch long, with pink pedicels, brownish

ivory-white corolla, with five teeth; the stamens ten, net
protruding; the style short, with a five-lobed stigma; the
capsule roundish, five-lobed, with many winged seeds.
We often find dead insects stuck to the stem. In winter,
the dry, dark red stalks, ornamented with pretty

<p>A handsome perennial, with leafy stems,
from five to fifteen inches tall, bearing one
or several, fine flowers at the top. They
are an inch and a half long, with a bright
blue corolla, dotted with green, with
plaited folds and small teeth between the five lobes. This
has been found in Yosemite, but is more common at Lake
Tahoe. There are many other handsome large Blue
Gentians in the West. <i>G. lùtea</i>, with yellow flowers, is the
German kind from which the well-known drug, gentian, is
made.

<h3 id="MILKWEED_FAMILY">MILKWEED FAMILY. <i>Asclepiadaceae.</i></h3>

<p>A large family, widely distributed, most abundant in
warm regions; ours are perennial herbs, usually with milky
juice and tough fibrous inner bark; leaves generally large,
toothless, without stipules; flowers peculiar in shape, in
roundish clusters; calyx with a short tube or none and five
lobes; corolla five-lobed; stamens five, on the base of the
corolla, with short, stout filaments, anthers more or less
united around the disk-like stigma, which covers and unites
the two short styles of the superior ovary. The two parts
of the ovary develop into two conspicuous pods, opening
at the side, containing numerous flattish seeds, arranged
along a thick, central axis, usually each with a tuft of
silky down to waft it about.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Asclepias, with oddly-shaped
flowers, interesting and decorative in form; calyx rather
small, the pointed sepals turned back; corolla with its
petals turned entirely back, so as to cover the sepals and
expose the peculiar-looking central arrangements of the
flower, called the "crown." In the middle is the large, flat,
shield-shaped, five-lobed or five-angled stigma, surrounded
by the anthers, which are more or less united to each other
and to the stigma, encircled by five, odd, little honey-bearing
hoods, the same color as the petals, each with a
horn, either enclosed within it or projecting from it, the
whole collection of stigma, anthers, and hoods, forming the
"crown." The pods are thick and pointed. Named for
Æsculapius, as some of these plants are medicinal. Indians
used to make twine from the fibrous bark of some kinds.</p>

with woolly pedicels, purplish-pink petals, and
waxy, white "hoods," the buds yellowish-pink. The
cluster, about three inches across, sometimes comprises
as many as fifty flowers and is very beautiful in tone, being
a mass of delicately blended, warm, soft tints of pink,
cream, and purple. This grows in canyon bottoms and
along streams.

inches across, dark in color and contrasting well with the
foliage. This is common in Yosemite and elsewhere in
California, at moderate altitudes.</p>

<p>The genus Asclepiodora, of the southern part of North
America, resembles Asclepias, but the flowers are larger,
the petals not turned back, the hoods flatter, with crests
instead of horns; leaves mainly alternate; corolla wheel-shaped;
petals spreading; hoods oblong, blunt, spreading
and curving upward, crested inside; five tiny appendages
alternating with the anthers and forming an inner crown
around the stigma. The name is from the Greek, meaning
the gift of Æsculapius.

<p>There are many kinds of Cuscuta, or Dodder, widely
distributed and difficult to distinguish; leafless parasites,
without green coloring, with twining, threadlike stems and
inconspicuous flowers, in clusters. The seed germinates in
the soil and produces a twining stem, which attaches itself
to a neighbor by means of suckers. These plants are
easily recognized, for they look like tangled bunches of
coarse thread, and are often very conspicuous on account of
their coloring, sometimes making fine masses of bright
orange-color, beautiful in tone, though the plants are very
unattractive. They have other names, such as Love-vine
and Strangle-weed.

<p>Very attractive common flowers, with
many stems, three to eight inches high,
from a woody base. The leaves are
smooth or somewhat downy, stiffish, pale
gray-green and rather harsh, and the
flowers are over three-quarters of an inch
across, clear pink, of various shades from
deep-pink to white, with an angled calyx. Only two yellow
stamens show in the throat and the style is long and
slender. This grows on hills and in valleys, as far east as
Colorado, and its pretty flowers are very gay and charming,
particularly when growing in large clumps in fields or
beside the road. <i>P. Stánsburyi</i>, common on the plateau
in the Grand Canyon, blooming in May, is similar, but has
sticky hairs on the calyx.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Gilia, variable and not easily
distinguished; the leaves nearly always alternate and thus
differing from Linanthus; the corolla funnel-form, tubular,
or bell-shaped, but, unlike Phlox, rarely salver-form and the
seeds are usually mucilaginous when wet. These plants
were named for Gil, a Spanish botanist.</p>

<p>A brilliant biennial or perennial plant,
varying in general form and color. In
Utah it is somewhat coarse and usually
has a single, leafy, roughish, rather
sticky stem, from one to two feet tall,
purplish towards the top, and thickish,
somewhat sticky leaves, deeply lobed and
cut, in a cluster at the root and alternate
along the stem, dull bluish-green in color, smooth on the
under side, with more or less sparse woolly down on the
upper side, as if partially rubbed off. The flowers have no
pedicels, or very short ones, and form small clusters in the
angles of the leaves along the upper part of the stem, but
are mainly at the top, in a large, handsome, somewhat
flat-topped, loose cluster. They are each more than half
an inch across, with a corolla of clear scarlet, the lobes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
shading at base to white, finely streaked with crimson and
prettily fringed at the tips. The stamens are equally or
unequally inserted in the corolla throat, the buds are
prettily twisted and fringed at the tips and usually have
a dark purplish calyx. Sometimes the flowers are all
scattered along the stalk, making a wand of bloom. This
grows on mountain sides and sometimes has a very disagreeable
smell, hence the local name of Polecat Plant.
In Yosemite it is much more delicate in character, with
several, smooth or downy, reddish, leafy stems, from one to
four feet high, from a branched base, bearing very graceful
clusters of flowers, the petals of various shades of scarlet,
pink, and crimson, often streaked with white, or yellowish
dotted with red, their long points curled back. Often the
buds are scarlet and the flowers pink, giving a very vivid
effect. The protruding stamens are inserted in the notches
between the lobes of the corolla, with red or pink filaments
and yellow or purple anthers. This has the look of a hothouse
flower and is very beautiful and striking when
growing in masses in high mountain woods. This has
several common names which are very misleading, such as
Wild Cypress and Wild Honeysuckle. There are several
named varieties. It grows in the Southwest and also from
British Columbia to New Mexico.</p>

<p>Very pretty flowers, which attract attention
because of their unusual coloring.
The leafy stem is from one to two feet
tall and slightly downy and the leaves are
generally toothless, smooth, and rather
dark green. The flowers form a roundish terminal cluster,
which is about two inches across, surrounded by broad
bracts, which are sticky to the touch. The corolla is
funnel-form, about an inch long, various shades of buff or
salmon-color, and as the downy buds are yellow, the newly-opened
flowers buff, and the older ones pinkish or cream-white,
the combinations of color are odd and effective.
This is quite common in Yosemite, in warm situations, and
much cultivated in Germany. It is sometimes called Wild
Bouvardia, but this is a poor name, as it is that of a plant
belonging to an entirely different family.</p>

often in coiled clusters; the calyx with five united sepals;
the corolla with five united petals; the stamens five, on the
base of the corolla and alternate with its lobes, with threadlike

ovary superior, the styles two or two-cleft; the fruit a

formerly supposed to have water-cavities in them, hence
the misleading name. Some of this family resemble some
of the Borages, but the stamens are long, the styles are
two, at least above, and the ovary has not the four conspicuous
lobes of the latter family.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Phacelia, hairy plants, with no
appendages between the sepals; resembling Hydrophyllum,

flowers are too small and too dull in color
for the general effect to be good. The
stems are about ten inches tall, purplish
and downy, and the leaves are dull green and rather
downy, with conspicuous veins. The buds are hairy and
the flowers are lilac and crowded in coiled clusters, to
which the long stamens give a very feathery appearance.
This is found in the mountains, as far east as Montana
and Colorado, and reaches an altitude of over twelve
thousand feet.</p>

<p>A little desert plant, not very pretty,
with several hairy flower-stalks, from
three to six inches tall, springing from a
rosette of soft thickish leaves, slightly
hairy, dull green in color, and something
the shape of the leaves of <i>P. Fremontii</i>,
but the lobes not nearly so small. The flowers are in
tightly coiled clusters; the corolla a little more than a
quarter of an inch across, dull white, with a pinkish line on
each lobe and lilac anthers, the general effect being mauve.</p>

<p>There are a good many kinds of Nemophila, natives of
North America, mostly Californian, slender, fragile herbs,
with alternate or opposite leaves, more or less divided, and
usually large, single flowers, with rather long flower-stalks.
The calyx has an appendage, resembling an extra
little sepal, between each of the five sepals, which makes
these plants easy to recognize, and the corolla is wheel-shaped
or bell-shaped, usually with ten, small appendages
within, at the base, and the petals are rolled up in the bud;
the stamens are short; the styles partly united. The name
is from the Greek, meaning "grove lover," because these
plants like the shade.

Nightshade. The stems are pale, square,
juicy and very brittle, from one to three
feet long, and the leaves are bright green
and most of them are alternate, with leafstalks
which are winged and clasping at base. The backs
of the leaves, and the stems and calyxes, are covered with

neighbors and give it the feeling of Bed-straw to the touch.
The flowers are nearly an inch across, with purple corollas,
shading to white in the center and paler outside, with
purple scales in the throat and purple stamens. This is
rather coarser than most Nemophilas and grows in light

<p>This is a charming little perennial
plant, which forms beautiful clumps of
delicate foliage and flowers, suggesting
some sort of Saxifrage. The many,
smooth, slender, pale green stems, from
four to nine inches tall, spring from slender,
threadlike rootstocks, bearing tubers, and the leaves are
mostly from the root, smooth, bright green, and prettily
scalloped, with long leaf-stalks. The flowers are in loose
clusters and are each half an inch or more long, with a
white corolla, which is without appendages inside and is
exceedingly beautiful in texture, with yellow stamens,
unequally inserted, and a long, threadlike style, with a
small stigma. These little plants grow in moist, shady
spots among the rocks, as far north as Alaska and often
reach very high altitudes, where it is a delight to find their
pearly flowers and lovely foliage in some crevice in the

as far north as Alaska and were named in honor of Count
Romanzoff, who sent the Kotzebue expedition to Alaska.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Emmenanthe, much like

sheathing the stem. The flowers are rather small,
with short pedicels, and a number are crowded together in
roundish clusters, about an inch across, with almost no
flower-stalk. The calyx is covered with white hairs, the
corolla is lilac or white, somewhat hairy on the outside, and
the stamens and style are long and conspicuous, sticking
out like cats' whiskers and giving a pretty feathery appearance
to the whole cluster, which becomes in fruit a conspicuous,
very fuzzy, round head, covered with bristly
white hairs, making the children's quaint common name
for this plant quite appropriate. It grows in rich soil, in
mountain woods, and is one of the earliest spring flowers.
It is sometimes called Bear's Cabbage, but this name is far
fetched, both as regards bears and cabbages!

usually with five sepals; corolla usually symmetrical, with
five united petals, often with crests or appendages in the
throat; stamens five, inserted in the tube of the corolla,
alternate with its lobes; ovary superior, with a single,
sometimes two-cleft, style, and usually deeply four-lobed,
like that of the Mint Family, forming in fruit four seed-like
nutlets. Mature fruit is necessary to distinguish the
different kinds. These plants superficially resemble some

<p>A rather attractive little plant, but inconspicuous
except when it grows in
patches, when it powders the fields with
white, like a light fall of snow, and suggests
the pretty Spanish name, which is a
diminutive of "nieve," or snow. The
slender, roughish stem is about ten inches tall, the light
green leaves are hairy, with fine bristles along the edges,
and the pretty little flowers are white, about a quarter of
an inch across, with yellow crests in the throat. Popcorn
Flower, <i>Plagiobòthrys nothofúlvus</i>, of the Northwest,
is also called Nievitas, as it often whitens the ground
with its small, fragrant, white flowers, which are very much
like the last.

<p>There are a good many kinds of Mertensia, natives of
the northern hemisphere. They are handsome perennials,
never very hairy and sometimes perfectly smooth all over,
with leafy stems and broad leaves, sometimes dotted, the
lower ones with leaf-stalks. The pretty, nodding flowers
are in clusters and have a purple, blue, or white corolla,
often turning pink, more or less trumpet-shaped, the lobes
not spreading much, the throat open, with or without
crests; the ovary deeply four-lobed, with a threadlike
style and one stigma; the nutlets wrinkled. These plants
are all commonly called Lungwort.</p>

<p>A very attractive and graceful mountain
plant, with pretty flowers and fine
foliage. The stems are hollow and usually
smooth, from one to five feet tall, and the
leaves are rather thin and soft in texture,
usually smooth, with a "bloom." The
flowers are in handsome loose clusters, most of them
drooping, and have a corolla over half an inch long, which
is a beautiful shade of bright light blue, often tinged with
pink, with white crests in the throat, and the style is long
and protruding. The buds are bright pink, contrasting
well with the blue flowers. This grows near streams, in the
higher mountains. It is often called Mountain Bluebell,
but that name belongs to Campanula and is therefore
misleading. (This has recently been "separated" into
several species.)</p>

<p>This is an attractive plant and looks
a good deal like a Forget-me-not. It
grows from four to ten inches tall and has
dull bluish-green leaves, which are downy

<p>This is not a pretty plant and is rather
insignificant because of its dull coloring.
It forms low, branching, straggling clumps,
with thickish stems and leaves, which
are succulent and perfectly smooth, with a
"bloom," and the flowers are small, the
corolla white or pale lilac, with a yellow
"eye" which changes to purple, forming
crowded coiled spikes, mostly in pairs, without bracts.
The fruit consists of four nutlets. This is widely distributed,
in moist, salty or alkaline places, growing also
in the East and in South America and the Old World.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Oreocarya, natives of western
North America and Mexico, coarse, hairy, perennial or
biennial herbs, with thick woody roots; the leaves narrow,
alternate or from the root; the flowers small, mostly white,
in clusters, with a funnel-form or salver-form corolla, usually
with crests and folds in the throat; the stamens not protruding;
the style usually short. The name is from the

<p>An attractive little plant, resembling
the little eastern Gill-over-the-ground,
with slender trailing stems, slightly downy

a quarter of an inch long. The calyx and
corolla are hairy on the outside; the
corolla has an erect upper lip, sometimes
notched, and a spreading, three-lobed
lower lip, and the stamens are four, the lower pair shorter.
This is common in shady places near the coast. It has a
pleasant aromatic fragrance and was used medicinally by
California Indians, so it was called "good herb" by the
Mission Fathers, and is still used as a tea by Spanish-Californians,
who call it Yerba Buena del Campo, "field
herb," distinguishing it from Yerba Buena del Poso, "herb
of the well," the garden mint.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Monardella, fragrant herbs,
all western, chiefly Californian; leaves mostly toothless;

California; shrubby plants, with wrinkled leaves and

<p>A low desert shrub, from two to three
feet high, varying very much in color.
On the plateau in the Grand Canyon it is
delicate and unusual in coloring, with pale
gray, woody stems and branches and
small, stiffish, gray-green, toothless leaves,
covered with white down. The small flowers are bright
blue, projecting from close whorls of variously tinted
bracts, and have long stamens, protruding from the
corolla-tube, with blue filaments and yellow anthers, and
a blue style. The bracts are sometimes lilac, sometimes
pale blue, or cream-color, but always form delicate pastelle
shades, peculiar yet harmonizing in tone with the vivid
blue of the flowers and with the pale foliage. This is
strongly aromatic when crushed. In the Mohave Desert it
is exceedingly handsome, but the coloring is often less
peculiar, as the foliage is not quite so pale as in other
places, such as the Grand Canyon, and the flowers vary
from blue to lilac or white. It blooms in spring and when
its clumps of purple are contrasted with some of the yellow
desert flowers, clustered about the feet of the dark Joshua
Trees which grow around Hesperia, the effect is very fine.</p>

<p>Not so handsome as the last, but a very
conspicuous plant, on account of its size
and the pale tint of its foliage, though the
flowers are too dull in color to be striking.
It is shrubby and has a number of stems,
which form a loose clump from three to
six feet high, with rather leathery, resinous
leaves, all but the upper ones with scalloped
edges, and the whole plant is covered with fine
white down, so that the general effect is pale gray, blending
with the white or pale lilac flowers and purplish buds. The
flowers are about half an inch long and are very queer in
form, for the only conspicuous part is the lower lip, which
is very broad with a ruffled edge and is turned straight up
and backward, so as to conceal almost all the rest of the
flower. The long jointed stamens, which are borne on the
lower lip, stand out awkwardly like horns and from one
side of the flower's face a long white pistil sticks out, with
something the effect of a very long cigar hanging out of the
corner of its mouth! All these eccentric arrangements are
apparently for the purpose of securing cross-pollination
from the bees, which frequent these flowers by the thousand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
as this is a famous bee-plant and the white honey

under the upper lip of the corolla, the lower pair longer.
This is usually not pretty, but in favorable situations in

<p>This is the only kind, a very curious
spiny desert shrub, about three feet high,
varying a great deal in general appearance
in different situations. The stems and
foliage are gray-green and imperceptibly
downy and the flowers are over three-quarters
of an inch long, with a corolla which is hairy
outside and has a lilac and white upper lip and a dark
blue lower one. The calyxes become inflated and form
very curious papery globes, over half an inch in diameter,
very pale in color, tinged with yellow, pink, or lilac, and
extremely conspicuous. In the desert around Needles,
in California, the general form of the shrub is very loose
and straggling, with slender twisting branches and small,
pale gray-green leaves, both flowers and leaves very
scanty and far apart, so that the bunches of bladder-like
pods are exceedingly conspicuous. In the Mohave Desert
it becomes a remarkably dense shrub, a mass of dry-looking,
criss-cross, tangled branches, spiky twigs, and
dull green leaves, speckled all over with the dark blue and
white flowers and the twigs crowded with pods. Sometimes
the flowers are magenta instead of blue, but are all
alike on one bush. The stems are not square, as in most
Mints. The drawing is of a plant at Needles.</p>

California</b></div>

<p>This is a rather handsome shrubby
plant, from two to five feet high, woody at
base, with many stout, leafy, woolly or
hairy stems, and rather coarse leaves,
hairy, more or less wrinkled and toothed,
and rather dark green. The flowers are
over an inch long, in pairs along the upper stem, something
the shape of a Monkey-flower, with a five-toothed calyx
and a corolla with four, short, spreading lobes and the
fifth lobe much longer and erect, the tube broad and dull-white,
with a hairy ring at the base inside, the lobes tinged
with pink or purple; the stamens four, one pair shorter.
After the flowers have faded the large, pale green, inflated
calyxes, veined with dull purple, become conspicuous.
If the flowers were brighter in color this would be very
handsome. It is strongly but rather pleasantly aromatic
and grows on dry hills in southern California. The name
is from the Greek, meaning "sage," as these plants have
sage-like foliage and smell, but the flowers are quite
different.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Salvia, widely distributed,
herbs or shrubs; flowers usually in whorls, with bracts;
upper lip of the corolla erect, seldom two-lobed, lower lip
spreading and three-lobed; resembling Ramona, except
that the two stamens have filaments which are apparently
two-forked, one fork bearing an anther cell and the other
only the mere rudiment of an anther; the smooth nutlets
are mucilaginous when wet. The Latin name means "to
save," as some kinds are medicinal.</p>

<p>A fantastically beautiful and decorative
plant, very individual in character. The
stout purplish stem, a foot or two tall and
covered with white wool, springs from a
rosette of thistle-like leaves of palest
green, so thickly covered with cushions
of white wool that they appear to be inflated, their teeth
tipped with brown spines. The stem bears a series of
flower-clusters, resembling large, round, pale balls of wool,
pierced here and there by long prickles and encircled by
lovely flowers, so etherial that they appear almost to hover
in the air. They are each about an inch long, the corolla
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
clear bright lilac with an erect upper lip with two lobes,
their fringed tips crossed one over the other, and the
lower lip with small side lobes and a very large, fan-shaped,
middle lobe, which is delicately fringed with white. The
pistil is purple and the anthers are bright orange, which
gives a piquant touch to the whole color scheme of pale
green and lilac. There are several tiers of these soft yet
prickly balls, which suggest the pale green turbans of an
eastern potentate, wreathed with flowers. The buds
poke their little noses through the wool, in a most fascinating
way, like babies coming out of a woolly blanket,
and fresh buds keep on coming through and expanding as
the faded blossoms fall, so that these flowers last longer in
water than we would expect from their fragile appearance.
The plants when they are crushed give out a rather heavy
smell of sage, with a dash of lemon verbena. They grow
on the dry open plains of the South.</p>

<p>This is an odd-looking plant, but is
often quite handsome. The stout purplish
stem, from six inches to over two feet tall,
springs from a cluster of rough, very
dull green leaves, sometimes so wrinkled
as to look like the back of a toad, and bears a series of
round, button-like heads, consisting of numerous, purple,
bristly bracts, ornamented with small, very bright blue
flowers. Though the flowers are small, the contrast
between their vivid coloring and the purple or wine-colored
bracts is very effective. The seeds have been
for centuries an important food product among the aborigines
and this plant in ancient Mexico was cultivated as
regularly as corn, the meal being extremely nourishing
and resembling linseed meal. The Mission Fathers used it
for poultices and it is still in demand among the Spanish-Californians.
This grows on dry hillsides and smells of
sage.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Trichostema, all North
American; herbs, sometimes shrubby; leaves toothless, or
with wavy margins; flowers in clusters; calyx usually with
five unequal lobes; corolla with a long slender tube and
five oblong lobes nearly alike, forming in bud a roundish
ball, enclosing the coiled stamens; stamens four, the upper
pair longer, with very long, blue or purple filaments,
conspicuously protruding from the corolla, suggesting
both the Greek name, meaning "hair-like stamens," and
the common name, Blue-curls.</p>

<p>This is shrubby and usually has many
stems, from two to four feet high, with
stiffish leaves, dark green on the upper
side, paler and woolly on the under, the
margins rolled back, and beautiful flower-clusters,
which are sometimes a foot long.
The bright blue corolla is nearly an inch
long, with a border shaped like a violet, the smaller
buds are pink, and the purple stamens and style are
two inches long and very conspicuous. The calyxes,
stems, and buds are all covered with fuzzy, pink wool,
forming a most unusual and beautiful color scheme,
giving a changeable almost iridescent effect of mauve
and pink, in remarkable contrast to the brilliant blue
of the flowers. This grows on rocky hills in southern
California, is pleasantly aromatic and used medicinally by
Spanish-Californians. <i>T. lanceolàtum</i> is called Camphor
Weed, because of its strong odor, like camphor but
exceedingly unpleasant. It grows on dry plains and low
hills in the Northwest and is an important bee-plant,
blooming in summer and autumn, and is also called
Vinegar Weed.</p>

<p>There are a few kinds of Agastache, all North American,
perennial herbs, mostly tall and coarse; leaves toothed,
with leaf-stalks; flowers small, in a terminal spike, with
bracts; calyx bell-shaped, with five teeth and slightly two-lipped;
corolla with a two-lobed, erect, upper lip, the lower
lip spreading and three-lobed, the middle lobe broader and
scalloped; stamens four, all with anthers, the upper pair
longer; nutlets smooth. The Greek name means "many

usually smooth, sometimes hairy, and
smoothish, dark green leaves. The small
flowers have a green calyx, with mauve
teeth, a white or pale violet corolla, and
long, protruding stamens, with lilac
anthers. They are crowded in spikes, from two to six
inches long, and the whole effect is rather bright purplish-pink,
feathery and pretty. This has a strong aromatic
smell and grows along the edges of meadows and is abundant
in Yosemite at moderate altitudes, but in other places
reaches an altitude of over eight thousand feet and is
found as far east as Colorado. <i>A. pallidiflòra</i>, with

bent, with a minutely two-cleft stigma. In fruit the calyx
becomes large and inflated, papery, angled and ribbed,
wholly enclosing the pulpy berry, which contains numerous,
flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The name is from the Greek,

<p>There are many kinds of Antirrhinum, natives of Europe,
Asia, and western North America; herbs; the lower leaves
often opposite, and the upper ones alternate; the sepals
five; the corolla two-lipped, swollen at the base on the
lower side, but with no spur, the palate nearly closing the
throat; the stamens four. The name is from the Greek,
meaning "nose-like," because the shape of the flowers
suggests the snout of an animal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Sticky Snap-dragon</b><br />
<i>Antirrhìnum

<b>Pink, purple<br />

<p>This is a conspicuous perennial, handsome
though rather coarse, hairy and
sticky all over, with stout leafy stems,
from two to five feet tall, with branches
but no tendrils, and soft, rather dark
green leaves. The flowers are half an
inch long, the corolla pink with a yellow
palate, and they are crowded in fine, long, one-sided
clusters. This is common in the South and looks a good
deal like some of the cultivated kinds; when its flowers are
pinched from the sides they open their mouths in the same
funny way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>White Snap-dragon</b><br />

<p>This has tendril-like pedicels, which
curl around nearby plants, but the stem is
stout and erect, over two feet tall, smooth
below and hairy above, with smooth,
dark green leaves, and bears a long,
crowded, one-sided cluster of pink buds
and pretty white flowers. They are each
about half an inch long, with hairy calyxes, and the corollas
are prettily tinged with lilac or pink, but are too pale in
color, though the general effect of the plant is rather
striking. The anthers are bright yellow. This grows in
the South. <i>A. vírga</i> is a smooth plant, from two and a half
to five feet tall, with many wand-like stems, springing
from a perennial base, and reddish-purple flowers, about
half an inch long, forming a long, rather one-sided cluster.
This grows in the chaparral, on ridges of the Coast Ranges,
blooming in June, but is not common.

<p>This is an odd-looking plant, from one
to two feet tall, which seems unable to
decide whether or not it is a vine, for the
pedicels of the flowers are exceedingly
slender and twist like tendrils and by their
means the plant clings to its neighbors and
raises its weak stems from the ground, or,
if it finds no support, it stands almost erect and waves its
tendrils aimlessly in the air. It is smooth all over, with
dark green leaves and pretty, bright purplish-blue flowers,
about half an inch long, with a pale, hairy palate, which
almost closes the throat. This grows in the South, near
the sea. <i>A. vàgans</i> is similar and is common farther north
in California, growing on dry open wooded hills or in
canyons of the Coast Ranges, blooming in summer and
autumn.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Castilleja, almost always
perennials, usually parasitic on the roots of other plants,
usually handsome and striking, the conspicuous feature
being the large leafy bracts, colored like flowers, which
adorn the upper part of the stem. They usually have
several stems, springing from woody roots; leaves alternate,
without leaf-stalks, green below and gradually merging
above into colored bracts; flowers crowded in terminal
clusters, mixed with bracts; calyx tubular, flattened, more
or less cleft in front or behind, or on both sides, the lobes
sometimes two-toothed, colored like the bracts, enclosing
the tube of the corolla; corolla less conspicuous and duller
in color than the calyx, tubular, two-lipped, the lower lip
short and very small, not inflated, with three small teeth,
the upper lip long and beaklike, enclosing the four
stamens and single threadlike style; stigma cap-shaped or
two-lobed; anther-sacs unequally attached to the filament,
one by its middle and the other hanging by its tip; capsule
egg-shaped or oblong, splitting open, containing many
seeds. These gaudy plants are well named Indian Paint
Brush, for the flower-cluster and leaf-tips look as if they
had been dipped in color. Red Feather is also good but
Painted Cup is rather poor, as there is nothing cup-like
about the flower. They were named for Castillejo, a
Spanish botanist.

<p>This is a very handsome kind, from two

smooth leaves, which are not crinkled,
toothed, or lobed, and with more or less
hairy bracts, which are beautifully tinted
with many shades of pink, red, and purple. This is a
magnificent plant, especially when we find it growing
along irrigation ditches, among blue Lupines, yellow Mimulus
and other bright flowers, where the combinations of
color are quite wonderful, and it is the handsomest and
commonest sort around Yosemite, where it grows in meadows
and moist places, from the foothills nearly up to

<p>This is not quite so large or handsome as

bracts are beautifully tipped with
scarlet and the flowers are also bright red.
The rough stem is a foot or more tall, the
roughish dark green leaves are not toothed

have three lobes. These plants grow in the mountains and
often make bright patches of color in the landscape.</p>

<p>This is very variable, and is usually
about a foot high, with several hairy
stems, springing from a long yellow root.
The leaves are slightly rough, but not
coarse, with fine white hairs along the
margins, and light gray-green in color,
the lowest ones not lobed, a few of the upper ones with two
lobes, but most of the leaves, and the bracts, slashed into
three lobes. The calyx is covered with white hairs, and
the upper lip of the corolla is bright green. The whole
plant is most beautiful and harmonious in color, not coarse
like many Castillejas, and the upper part is clothed with
innumerable delicate yet vivid tints of salmon, rose, and
deep pink, shading to scarlet and crimson, forming a
charming contrast to the quiet tones of the lower foliage.
This grows in gravelly soil, on dry plains and hillsides, and
the clumps of bloom are very striking among the sage-brush.

<p>This is one of the most attractive of the
little Speedwells, for its flowers are bright
and quite large. The stems are branching,
hairy and purplish, some short and erect,
others long and trailing, and the leaves
are alternate above and opposite below,
dull yellowish-green, hairy and rather
soft, with scalloped edges. The flowers grow singly, on
slender flower-stalks over an inch long, springing from the
angles of the upper leaves, and the corolla is three-eighths of
an inch across, the upper lobe deep brilliant blue, veined
with dark blue, the side lobes similar in color but not so
bright, the lower lobe almost white, without blue veins,
and each lobe with a little pale yellow at its base. The
stamens and pistil are white, the anthers becoming brown
and the style bent to one side, and the capsule is somewhat
heart-shaped, containing several cup-shaped seeds. This
forms patches along roadsides and in fields, the soft foliage
dotted with the quaint bright blue flowers, opening a few
at a time in bright sunlight and closing at night. This is a

<p>There are a great many kinds of Pentstemon and some
of our handsomest and most conspicuous western flowers
are included among them. They are natives of North
America, chiefly herbs, sometimes branching below; the
leaves usually opposite, the upper ones without leaf-stalks
and more or less clasping; the flowers showy, in long clusters;
the calyx with five lobes; the corolla two-lipped,
with a more or less swollen tube, the upper lip two-lobed,
the lower three-cleft and spreading; the stamens four, in
pairs, and also a fifth stamen, which is merely a filament
without any anther, but is conspicuous and often hairy;
the style threadlike, with a round-top stigma; the pod
usually pointed; the seeds numerous. The common name,
Beard-tongue, is in allusion to the usually hairy tip of the
sterile filament. Pentstemon is from the Greek meaning
five stamens. This name is often mispronounced; the
accent should be on the second syllable and long.</p>

leaves, with more or less "bloom,"
toothless and thickish, the upper ones
somewhat clasping. The flowers are not

cluster about eight inches long. The sepals are
narrow and pointed, the corolla is tinted with various
beautiful shades of blue and purple, often with a white
throat and blue lobes, or with a pink throat and deep blue
lobes, the sterile filament has a thickened, more or less
hairy, yellow tip, and the pale yellow anthers are more or
less hairy. This plant is beautiful in every way, for the
foliage is fine in form and color and the flowers are brilliantly
variegated, yet harmonious and graceful. This
grows on hillsides and in mountain valleys, at rather high
altitudes, and used to be common and conspicuous on the
"benches" around the Salt Lake Valley, but it is gradually
being exterminated by sheep. It thrives and improves
when transplanted into gardens. <i>P. acuminàtus</i> is similar,

<p>A bushy plant, from two to five feet
high, with many smooth, slender branches,
terminating in long loose clusters of
flowers. The leaves are smooth, rather
dark green, the lower ones sharply toothed,
and the flowers are three-quarters of an
inch long; the corolla flesh-color, tipped
with pink, with some purple lines on the lower lip, and
some fine white hairs on the upper; the buds yellow, tipped
with dark red. These flowers are too dull in color to be
effective, but they are sweet-smelling and have ridiculous
faces with widely yawning mouths. This is quite common
in Yosemite, forming large clumps on open rocky slopes.
Indians use the tough stems for making baskets.</p>

<p>Exceedingly handsome, with smooth,
pale green stems, two feet or more tall,
and smooth, rather bluish-green leaves,
with slightly rippled edges. The corolla
is an inch and a quarter long, vivid scarlet,
paler inside, strongly two-lipped, with
long, conspicuous stamens, with pale
yellow anthers, the style remaining on the tip of the capsule
like a long purple thread. This makes splendid clumps
of gorgeous color and is common on the rim of the Grand
Canyon.</p>

<p>There are a number of kinds of Collinsia, natives of
North America, with the leaves opposite or in whorls; the
flowers single or in whorls; the calyx five-cleft; the corolla
irregular, with a short tube and two-lipped; the upper lip
two-cleft and more or less erect, the lower lip larger and
three-lobed, the side lobes spreading or drooping, the middle
lobe keel-like and folded together and enclosing the two
pairs of stamens and the threadlike style, which has a
small round-top or two-lobed stigma. The fifth stamen is
represented by a minute gland on the upper side of the
corolla tube near the base. The form of the flowers somewhat
suggests those of the Pea Family. If we pull the
lower lip apart we find the odd little crevice in which the
stamens are concealed.

<p>These are charming plants, from six
inches to a foot and a half tall, with very
delicately made flowers. The leaves are
smooth or downy and more or less toothed,
with rough edges, and the flowers are
arranged in a series of one-sided clusters along the upper
part of the stem, which is more or less branching. The
corollas are about three-quarters of an inch long and vary
in color, being sometimes all white. In the shady woods
around Santa Barbara they often have a white upper lip,
which is tipped with lilac and specked with crimson, and a
lilac lower lip, and here they are much more delicate in
appearance than on the sea-cliffs at La Jolla, where they
grow in quantities among the bushes and are exceedingly
showy. In the latter neighborhood the flowers are nearly
an inch long and the upper lip is almost all white and
marked with a crescent of crimson specks above a magenta
base, and the lower lip is almost all magenta, with a white
stripe at the center, the contrast between the magenta
and white being very striking and almost too crude. The
arrangement of the flowers is somewhat suggestive of the
many stories of a Chinese pagoda and the plant is common.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Scrophularia, most of them
natives of Europe. They are rank perennial herbs, usually
with opposite leaves; the corolla with no spur and with
five lobes, all erect except the lowest one, which is small
and turned back; the stamens five, four of them with
anthers and the fifth reduced to a scale under the upper
lip. These plants are supposed to be a remedy for scrofula.

<p>There are many kinds of Mimulus, or Monkey-flower,
usually growing in moist places, with erect or slanting,
juicy stems; leaves opposite, usually toothed; flowers
generally handsome, on flower-stalks from the axils of the
leaves; calyx covering the tube of the corolla, bell-shaped,
five-angled and five-toothed, upper tooth usually larger;
corolla two-lipped, the upper lip with two lobes, erect or
turned back, the lower with three, rounded, spreading
lobes, the tube not swollen at base and with a pair of
ridges within on the lower side; stamens four, in pairs, not
inclosed in the upper lip, their two anther-cells spreading
apart, no rudiment of a fifth stamen; style threadlike,
stigma with two, flat, spreading tips. When an insect
alights it touches the stigma, which immediately folds its
tips together, thus exposing the anthers, so that the insect
becomes dusted with pollen. This can be observed by
touching the stigma with a pencil. The odd little grinning
face of these flowers suggested both the common name and
the Greek, derived from "ape."</p>

<p>There are numerous kinds of Orthocarpus, many of
them Californian, difficult to distinguish. Like Castilleja,
their upper leaves often pass into colored bracts and the
calyx is colored, but the corolla is not similar, for the upper
lip is small and the three-lobed lower lip is swollen and
conspicuous; calyx short, four-cleft; stamens four, two of
them short, enclosed in the upper lip; style long, with a
round-top stigma; leaves without leaf-stalks, usually alternate,
often cut into three to five narrow divisions; fruit
an oblong capsule with many seeds. Perhaps it is called
Owl's-clover because, in some kinds, the flowers look like
the faces of owls.

<p>A large family, widely distributed, chiefly tropical. Ours
are herbs, or shrubs; leaves opposite or in whorls; flowers
regular, usually perfect; calyx with four teeth or none;
corolla with four or five united lobes, often hairy inside;
stamens on the corolla, as many as its lobes and alternate
with them; ovary inferior, with one or two styles; fruit a
capsule, berry, or stone-fruit. Coffee, Quinine, and Madder,
used for dye, belong to this family. I am told that the
latter plant is escaping around Salt Lake and is well
established there. The Latin name means "red."</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Houstonia, North American,
usually growing in tufts, leaves opposite; flowers small;
calyx four-lobed; corolla funnel-form or salver-form, four-lobed;
style slender, with two long stigmas; fruit a capsule.
Sometimes the flowers are perfect, but usually they are of
two kinds, one kind with high anthers and short pistil,
the other kind with long pistil and anthers inside the corolla-tube;
visiting insects carry pollen from the high anthers of
the one to the high stigmas of the other, and from the low
anthers to the low stigmas, thus ensuring cross-pollination.</p>

mixed; the calyx with from five to fifteen bristle-like teeth,
curled up and inconspicuous in flower, but spread out and
feathery in fruit; the corolla white or pink, more or less
funnel-form, with five nearly equal lobes; the stamens
three; the style sometimes with three minute lobes. The

tall, from a creeping rootstock, with
smooth, juicy, hollow stems and handsome
bright green foliage. The leaves are
smooth and the leaflets of the stem-leaves are coarsely
toothed. The flowers are white or pinkish, with pink
buds, and are crowded in fine large, rather flat-topped
clusters. The stamens are long and give a pretty feathery
appearance to the cluster. The flowers are strongly sweet-scented,
but the roots usually have a horrible smell when
they are broken. <i>V. sylvática</i> looks much the same, but
the leaves are mostly toothless, and it is widely distributed
in the United States, both East and West, also growing in
Asia. Both are woodland plants, liking rich moist soil.</p>

corollas are regular, with five lobes, delicate pink, veined
with deeper color and paler at the margins, with a white
pistil and four, white stamens, not protruding. The fruit
is roundish and dry, with one seed. This often carpets the
forest floor with its glossy foliage, ornamenting the moss

<h3 id="SUNFLOWER_FAMILY">SUNFLOWER FAMILY. <i>Compositae.</i></h3>

<p>The youngest and largest plant family, comprising about
seven hundred and fifty genera and ten thousand species,
highly specialized for insect pollination, easily recognized
as a whole, but many of its members difficult to distinguish.
Some tropical kinds are trees; ours are usually herbs,
sometimes shrubs, without stipules; the leaves opposite,
alternate or from the root; the flowers all small and
crowded in heads, on the enlarged top of the flower-stalk,
which is called the "receptacle," and surrounded by a
common involucre of separate bracts, few or many, arranged
in one or more rows; the receptacle also sometimes
having scale-like or bristle-like bracts among the flowers, its
surface smooth, or variously pitted and honey-combed. The
flowers are sometimes perfect, or with only pistils, or only
stamens, or with stamens and pistils on different plants, or
all kinds mixed. The calyx-tube is sometimes a mere ring,
or its margin consists of hairs, bristles or scales, called the
"pappus." The corollas are chiefly of two sorts; they are
tubular and usually have five lobes or teeth, but often the
flowers around the margin of the head are strap-shaped, that
is, the border of the corolla is expanded into what is called
a "ray." For instance, the yellow center, or "disk," of a
Daisy is composed of a crowded mass of tiny tube-shaped
flowers, which is surrounded by a circle of white, strap-shaped
flowers, or rays, which look like petals. A Thistle,
on the other hand, has no rays and the head is made up of
tube-shaped flowers only. Stamens usually five, on the
corolla-tube, alternate with its lobes, anthers usually united
into a tube surrounding the style, which has two branches
in fertile flowers, but usually undivided in sterile flowers;
ovary inferior, one-celled, maturing into an akene, often
tipped with hairs from the pappus to waft it about, or with
hooks or barbs to catch in fur of animals. (Descriptions
of genera have been omitted as too technical.)</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Carduus (Cnicus) (Cirsium),
widely distributed; with tubular flowers only.</p>

symmetrically lobed and toothed, the margins armed with
long yellow prickles. The flower-heads are an inch and a
half long, with beautiful carmine and pale-pink flowers,
all with no tinge of purple, the vivid spots of color giving
a very brilliant effect in contrast with the pale foliage.
This grows in the Grand Canyon and is conspicuous along

stem, covered with white wool, and alternate,
toothless leaves, which are rather
long and narrow, gray-green and more or
less woolly on the upper side, pale and
woolly on the under. The flower-heads are numerous,
forming close, roundish clusters. The heads are without
rays, but the tiny, yellow, tubular flowers are surrounded
by many small, white, papery bracts, resembling petals,
making the involucre the conspicuous feature and forming
a pretty little, round, white head. This is common in dry
places, East and West, and found in Asia. There is a
picture in Mathews' <i>Field Book</i>. Rosy Everlasting,
<i>Antennària ròsea</i>, has the same general appearance, but
the bracts are pink, giving a pretty pink tint to the flower-cluster,
and is found in the Northwest at high altitudes.
Another kind of Everlasting is <i>Gnaphàlium microcéphalum</i>,
Cudweed, a mountain plant of the Northwest and California,
with similar foliage, but with larger, looser clusters of
cream-white flowers, conspicuous at a distance, though
not pretty close by. There is a picture of a similar species

which are roughened with minute prickles
on the margins and under sides, but look quite shiny. The
flower-heads are over half an inch long, in western Arizona
usually without any rays, and are not especially pretty, like
a starved Sunflower whose rays have shrivelled away in the
dry heat of the desert, but the effect of the foliage, which

with stiff, overlapping bracts. This is larger in cultivation
and is a very useful plant, for its flowers yield honey
and a yellow dye, its seeds oil and food, the leaves are good
for fodder, and the stalks for textile fiber. It is common
nearly everywhere along roadsides, as far east as Missouri,
and is found as a stray in the East.

<p>This is the common Salsify, the root of
which is used as a vegetable. It is naturalized
from Europe and is now quite
common in the West as a "stray" and
also in the East. It has a smooth, stout,
hollow stem, from two to over four feet
tall, rather dark green, smooth leaves,
clasping at base, and handsome flowers from two to four
inches across, which are a very peculiar shade of reddish-purple,
not usually seen in flowers. They open early in
the morning, closing by midday and fading almost immediately
when picked, and may be seen growing along
the edges of fields and just outside garden fences where
they are often quite conspicuous. This plant has many
common names, such as Jerusalem Star, Nap-at-noon, and
Vegetable Oyster.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
